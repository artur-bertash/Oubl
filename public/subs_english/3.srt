00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,200
Good morning, ladies, good morning, young ladies, good morning, gentlemen.

4
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,740
We are going to learn French.

5
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,780
And to learn French...

6
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,940
We are going to invent a story.

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,720
That's it. Very good.

8
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,620
We are going to invent a story.

9
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,560
We are going to invent a story about a young French girl,

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,060
A young American man, friends, French friends, Japanese, English, Italian friends, lots of friends.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,180
Adventures, journeys, it's going to be a real novel.

12
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,280
A collaborative novel, a collective novel.

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,120
Because we're going to invent this together, you and I.

14
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,400
Do you like novels?

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,960
Yes. Well, it depends.

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,740
Do you like romance novels?

17
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh no, I don't like romance novels. I hate them.

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,960
Oh really, you don't like romance novels.

19
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,420
What do you like? Do you like adventure novels, fantasy novels, or science fiction novels?

20
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,480
Oh no, I don't like that.

21
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,260
Do you prefer detective novels?

22
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,440
Yes.

23
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,440
And you, miss, do you like detective novels?

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,800
Non.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:47,680
No. Do you like romance novels? No. No. You don't like romance novels either. Do you like adventure novels? No. No. But then, do you like science fiction novels? No. No. But then, but then, you don't like novels at all? No.

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,920
Oh really, you don't like novels. You prefer movies?

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,160
Yes.

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
I also prefer the cinema.

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,680
What do you prefer? Swedish films? Japanese films?

30
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,680
English comedies? Italian comedies?

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,660
American musicals?

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,660
You don't like comedies. Neither do I. I don't like comedies.

33
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,040
I prefer tragedies, dramas.

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,780
I love crime stories with lots of victims.

35
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,240
I also love crime stories.

36
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,060
Are we going to see a crime in the story?

37
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,740
A crime? I don't know.

38
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,600
Maybe. We'll see.

39
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,700
Let's see. Let's continue inventing the story.

40
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:56,360
Let's start with the young man, he's American, he's arriving in France.

41
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,200
He is at the airport

42
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:23,020
The police pass.

43
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
We can't get through.

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,480
Go ahead, you can pass.

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,180
You may pass.

46
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:56,320
Now he is at customs with two other young men.

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,660
Are all three of you French?

48
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,520
No, miss and I are American.

49
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,660
Ah, you speak English?

50
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,200
Of course, since we are Americans.

51
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,660
And you, are you American too?

52
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,200
No, they are American, but I am Brazilian.

53
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,420
You have nothing to declare?

54
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,620
Non.

55
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,280
Non.

56
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,440
Okay, you can go through.

57
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Go ahead! Go through!

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Is it true that you're Brazilian?

59
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Of course, why not?

60
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Where are you?

61
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
The university residence, at the Brazilian house.

62
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Is there a Brazilian house in the city?

63
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Of course, there is a Brazilian house for Brazilian students.

64
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,820
Brazilian. And an American house for Americans. Obviously, that's where you go.

65
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,720
Yes. And you, are you going to the American house? No, I'm not going to the projects. I'm in the neighborhood.

66
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:03,260
Latin. Are you taking a taxi? No, the shell or the train. And you? I'm taking a taxi. Goodbye.

67
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:39,440
...

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:07:06,060
So let's see, what kind of story are we going to choose?

69
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,060
A romance novel or an adventure novel?

70
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,680
That's a romance novel.

71
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,060
And that, that's an adventure novel.

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,760
And that, that too, is an adventure novel.

73
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,060
And that, that, that's a love story.

74
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,640
Look at this lady.

75
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,060
She is reading a romance novel.

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,140
And what is she reading here?

77
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,760
An adventure novel.

78
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,940
And you, what do you prefer?

79
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,900
Romance novels, detective novels, or science fiction?

80
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,500
Look, this is a detective novel.

81
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,600
That too is a detective novel.

82
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,580
But that's a science fiction novel, a speculative fiction novel.

83
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,720
That too is a science fiction novel.

84
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,660
And what is this?

85
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,500
A detective novel or a science fiction novel?

86
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,120
It's a detective novel.

87
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,620

That's a science fiction novel.

89
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,380

And that's a detective novel.

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,920
That's a detective novel.

92
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,820
And that's a crime film.

93
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,060
That too is a crime film.

94
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,360
That's a comedy.

95
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,580
That's an English comedy. It's an English film.

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,380
That's a Swedish film.

102
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,900
A comedy? No, more like a tragedy.

103
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,260
That's a Canadian film.

104
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,500
Is it a comedy? No, more like a tragedy.

105
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,840
Okay, now let's see what you like.

00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,300
Do you like Italian comedies? Chocolate candies?

107
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,000
Look at Marie-Laure. She really likes chocolate candies.

108
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,840
She loves it.

109
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,840
Do you like it?

110
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,720
Yes, a lot.

111
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,460
I love chocolates.

She loves chocolates and she loves Uncle Guillaume.

I love Uncle Guillaume.

114
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,100
Let's recap.

115
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,640
Let's see what Marie-Laure likes.

116
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,020
and what she doesn't like.

117
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,380
Chocolates? Yes, she likes them.

118
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,500
Cream puffs? Yes, she likes them.

She likes it.

120
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,960
She likes cream puffs,

121
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,920
But she prefers lightning.

122
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,360
She loves éclairs.

123
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,420
She loves stories.

124
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,460
But she doesn't like learning her lessons.

125
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,260
Uncle Guillaume? Oh yes, she likes Uncle Guillaume.

She adores Uncle Guillaume.

127
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,560
Mireille loves detective novels

128
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,280
But she hates being tickled.

129
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,660
Stop, I hate it!

130
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,120
We're going to ask a few people what they like

131
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,580
Which do you prefer, romance novels or adventure novels?

132
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,820
Adventure novels

133
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,280
And science fiction, do you like it?

134
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,640
Not many

135
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,100
Do you like romance novels?

136
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,740
No not at all

137
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,000
Adventure novels?

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,220
Yes, adventure novels or detective novels.

139
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,060
Speculative fiction novels, science fiction?

140
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,900
No, not really.

141
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,600
Do you like adventure novels?

142
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,340
Ah yes, a lot.

143
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,600
Do you like detective novels?

144
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,220
Yes, detective novels, yes.

145
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,960
Which do you prefer, romance novels or detective novels?

146
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,720
In between, there are detective novels.

147
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,300
Now you are going to speak French.

148
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,380
Listen to this dialogue between Robert and Mireille

149
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,180
You will repeat Mireille's answers

150
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,820
Do you like novels?

151
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,080
Oh yes, well, it depends

152
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,780
Do you like romance novels?

153
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,060
Oh no, I don't like romance novels, I hate them.

154
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,680
Now it's your turn, you are Mireille

155
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,580
Do you like novels?

156
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,860
Oh yes, well, it depends

157
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,460
Oh yes, well, it depends

158
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,060
Oh yes, well, it depends

159
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,180
Do you like romance novels?

160
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,420
Oh no, I don't like romance novels, I hate them.

161
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,700
Oh no, I don't like romance novels, I hate them.

162
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,820
Oh no, I don't like romance novels, I hate them.

163
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,440
I love Japanese films

164
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,080
And you, do you like Japanese films?

165
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,800
Oh yes !

166
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,180
But Japanese films are not very useful for learning French.

167
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,380
So we're going to invent a French story,

168
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:44,580
with young French people, French adventures, trips to France.

169
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,520
Are we going to have a crime?

170
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,940
In crime movies, there's always a crime.

171
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:05,000
If you want, we can have a crime in the story, a crime with a criminal and a

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,420
victim, if you want to commit a crime, we can, it's easy, we can, it's possible, we can

173
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:29,820
Yes, thank you, I can, and you can do that too, of course. Why not?

174
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:43,820
No, you can't. No, he can't. I can. You can. She can. We can. You can.

175
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:53,620
They can, they can, if you want, you can have a crime in the story, we'll see.

176
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:59,320
A crime in history, yes or no, maybe, maybe, we'll see about that.

177
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:09,620
It depends, we'll see. You give me a ball of gum, maybe? We'll see about that.

178
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,140
depends on whether you are nice

179
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,080
Maybe, I don't know, we'll see.

180
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Look, you'll see.

181
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
I'll go see.

182
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
What is this ?

183
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
I don't know, we'll see.

184
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
Oh, candy! Are they good?

185
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
I'll go see.

186
00:14:42,080 --> 00:15:01,100
Yes, they're good, and as for me, I don't know, we'll have to see, it depends, we'll see, we'll

187
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:15,680
Start the story. Start. Come on, start, start. Okay, I'll start, then. Let's see.

188
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:28,100
Well, go ahead, start. Let's see, where do I start?

189
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:38,500

190
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,700
You start.

191
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,740
Okay, let's begin. Let's start the story.

192
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,520
At the beginning of the story, a young man arrives in France.

193
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,560
A young man. A young man. A young man.

194
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,880
And that's the young man in the story.

195
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:18,680
A young man, the young man in the story. A young man, undefined. The young man, defined. A young girl, the young girl in the story. A young girl, undefined. The young girl, defined.

196
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:30,680
"Young people," "The young people of history." "Young people," indefinite article. "The young people," definite article.

197
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:40,060
Okay, so the young man in the story arrives here, the plane arrives here, it's the

198
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:52,600
The train is arriving, it's arriving here. The train is leaving, it's leaving, it's arriving, it's leaving, it's arriving.

199
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,720
When a celebrity arrives for a visit, it always starts with music.

200
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:13,540
Now, look closely. Is he arriving or leaving? He's arriving. Is she arriving or leaving? She's arriving. Look at Marie-Laure here. Is she leaving or arriving? She's leaving.

201
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,140
And Robert here, is he arriving or leaving? He's arriving.

202
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,680
And this young girl, is she arriving or leaving? She's arriving.

203
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,800
And the bus here, is it leaving or arriving? It's leaving.

204
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,200
And here he arrives.

205
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,200
Miss, it's for you. Yes, I'm coming. I'm leaving.

206
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,760
He arrives, he leaves. To arrive, to leave.

207
00:17:43,540 --> 00:18:02,860
The young man arrives in France. He is at the airport. It's Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. It's one of the airports in Paris. It's an international airport.

208
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:15,520

212
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,080
The police officer looks at his passport.

213
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,400
Here is a French passport.

214
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,260
But Robert has an American passport, obviously, since he is American.

215
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
Then he goes through customs.

216
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,480
Customs.

217
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,700

219
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,960
Robert has nothing to declare.

220
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,060
He can pass, since he has nothing to declare.

221
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,440

329
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:34,040
The student quarter, the university quarter.

330
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,100
Let's recap. We are going to learn French.

331
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,020
To learn French, we are going to invent a story.

332
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,460
For the sake of the story, we will choose two young people.

333
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,480
The young people will make friends.

334
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,700
To learn, to invent, to choose, to have, that's the infinitive.

335
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:05,000
Learn, understand, take in, be, do

336
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:14,800
To invent, to love, to adore, to hate, to begin, to go

337
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:28,240
And choosing, leaving, coming, having, seeing, being able to, knowing, all of these are infinitives.

338
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,780
Okay, let's see what you've learned.

339
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,460
I am the professor and you are the students.

340
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,660
We are going to learn French.

341
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,660
To learn French, we are going to invent a story.

342
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,700
It's going to be the story of two young people.

343
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,140
A young girl and a young man.

344
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,660
The young man in the story is going to be...

345
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,780
American.

346
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,160
American.

347
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,660
At the beginning of the story, the young man arrives in...

348
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,020
In France.

349
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,920
He is at...

350
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,740
The airport.

351
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,640
At the airport.

352
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,660
He is with two others...

353
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,000
Young people.

354
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:23,140
He goes through the police, he goes through the net, then he takes a taxi to go to Paris.

355
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,600
That's all for today.

356
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,480
Goodbye ladies, goodbye young ladies, goodbye gentlemen.
