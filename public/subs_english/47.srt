2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You have to look and fly away.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And you will be able to say a few words in French yourself.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Our travelers continue to discuss their itinerary.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is possible to circumnavigate France by boat

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
by water, shores and canals.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hubert and Jean-Michel disagree

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
with the real France.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And the man in black comes to the door

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
with a strange story

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:24,980
Subtitling by Radio-Canada

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,500
I bring the castles of France.

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,800
The others aren't here?

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,320
There you go.

16
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm going to open it for them.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,200
Hello.

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,820
Hello, hello.

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,840
Go ahead.

20
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,900
Hello everyone.

21
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,900
Hello children.

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,060
But you're carrying a lot of stuff, what are you bringing?

23
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,340
Emilio's taste, the car journal guide, the Michelin guide with the three-star map,

24
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,680
Madeleines from Commercy, berlingots from Carpentras, nougat from Montélimar

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,980
and some Cambrai nonsense for Marie-Laure.

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,500
Well, I think you're spoiling her a little too much.

27
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,440
I hope she'll let us taste a little of it.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,440
I don't know. We'll have to see.

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,440
If you take me with you, fine. Otherwise, I'll keep everything.

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,440
But then, Marie-Laure, you know very well that we can't take you.

31
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
You will go to Saint-Jean-de-Luz with mom and dad.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,440
No, no, I don't want to go to Saint-Jean-de-Luz with mom and dad.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
I'll go with you. I don't care.

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,440
If you don't want to take me, I'll go alone.

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,440
And I won't say where I'm going. And you'll be in a real bind.

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,440
But then, Marie-Laure, stop talking nonsense and offer everyone a candy.

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Not you! What do you want, my beloved cowboy?

38
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Nonsense from Cambrai?

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Carpentras berlingots?

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Montélimar nougat?

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Or madeleines from Commercy?

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
That's stupid.

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
And me?

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Oh, just a minute!

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Is this the green guide to Normandy and Brittany that I was supposed to bring?

46
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
THANKS.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,040
Yes, yes, yes, there is a small grocery store.

48
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,580
So, we all agree, we're going to Rouen first, to Tourcoing.

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,040
Okay, I've thought it through, we're not going to Rouen, nor to Tourcoing, but to Where-is-it-there?

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,640
Where is it? Where is it at? Where is it?

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,700
At sea, 20 kilometers off the coast of Brittany.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,100
Okay, I have an idea, we put the table aside and put the map on the floor, that will be better.

53
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,040
Yes, yeah.

54
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:54,560
Yeah, that's an idea, let's do France by boat, France by boat, it's me, you want to lead in

55
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,000
boat, but no, my dear friend, nobody wants to deceive you, I wouldn't presume to

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,720
Making fun of you? No, no, it's completely serious, I'm not joking. We can very well do the

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,340
France by boat, think of the 5000 km of coastline, that's a lot of beaches, we'll all be able to swim

58
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:20,160
The days and the minute 1 it depends where I don't swim in the English Channel or in the sea

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:29,760
No way from the north, it's too cold, sir, you chilly person, but dear sir, in the USSR there are

60
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,000
People swimming in January amidst ice floes and polar bears, it's true, I don't...

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm not sure. They probably have thermal suits. I can see that perfectly well.

62
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,400
How could we travel along the coast from Belgium to the Basque Country? But how?

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,080
Getting from there to the Mediterranean, that's harder for me to see. Even if Louis XIV abolished it

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,180
The Pyrenees. But he didn't actually remove them. No problem. We're going back up

65
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,160
the Garonne and then we take the Canal du Midi, yet another great achievement of Louis XIV

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,760
in parentheses, and we arrive at the Mediterranean.

67
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,060
Oh dear, some people are starting to annoy me with their Louis XIV.

68
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,440
That said, I acknowledge that you can go almost anywhere by boat.

69
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,960
with all these rivers, all these streams, all these canals.

70
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,100
Yes, of course. From the English Channel, we could go up the Seine,

71
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,820
then the Marne, from the Marne, passing into the Saône via the canal,

72
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,720
From the Saône, we pass into the Rhône,

73
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,080
and we descend gently all the way to the Mediterranean.

74
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,380
And we're going to eat bouillabaisse in Marseille.

75
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,080
This is the real bouillabaisse from Marseille.

76
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,080
Do you want the recipe?

77
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,620
But I'm thinking about it.

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,420
My family has a small sailboat in Villequier.

79
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,900
Perhaps we could borrow it?

80
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,300
Hey, wait a minute, I don't want to go drown in the prime of my life.

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,360
Why would you drown? Do you know how to swim?

82
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,800
Yes, but sailing in Villequier is dangerous.

83
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,300
For what ?

84
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,700
Well, you know, Victor Hugo?

85
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,020
Yes.

86
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,800
Well, he had a daughter.

87
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,120
Yes.

88
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,080
And that girl, she got married.

89
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,600
Yeah.

90
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,740
And one day, she went with her husband to Villequier, on the Seine, to a family property.

91
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,300
And there was a boat, a sailboat.

92
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,200
And she went boating on the Seine with her husband.

93
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,940
And the boat capsized and she drowned.

94
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,660
So what?

95
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,400
And so, Victor Hugo wrote a poem.

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,480
And you, you don't want to go drown yourself at Villequier because dad wouldn't write a poem.

97
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,240
There you go, you've got it all figured out.

98
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:37,180
Well, I don't want to drown myself in the prime of my life either, and besides, I'm not going to

99
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,660
not spending the summer sightseeing on some rich kid's yacht, I'd have bad faith and

100
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,180
Besides, you can't discover the real France on a yacht anyway, can you?

101
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,980
We need to go and see the working France, we need to go and see the steelworkers and...

102
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:01,280
Lorraine, the underground miners, you have to go see how Michelin tires, Airbus, and cars are made.

103
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:09,320
Renault and the pebbles, that's France, the real France, it's the workers.

104
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,720
Workers aren't the ones who make Renaults, oh no! And who do you think the robots are?

105
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,360
And then you make me laugh with your petty arguments about France perhaps being at the forefront

106
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,840
Progress with the hook stitch; the hook stitch is a magnificent technical achievement.

107
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,620
Commercial, sure, but there are even more remarkable things, take the machined one for example.

108
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,300
The tidal power plant on the Rance River, for example, 1. It's not everywhere that electrical energy is generated with

109
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,920
The force of the tides, you make me laugh with your tidal power plant, the tidal power plant of the Rance, yes, that's it

110
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,480
Not bad, oh, but the Russians also have a tidal power plant that they copied from ours.

111
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,080
It's something to see, it's all been seen before, besides, it's not just the Russians, the whole world copies us

112
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,340
Because all the great discoveries originated in France.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:20,300
Pasteurization, radioactivity, the tin can, the stethoscope, champagne, aviation, the telegraph, cinema, Carnot's principle, foie gras, love, freedom.

114
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,120
It's impossible to be that chauvinistic.

115
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,060
Here, something that's really great,

116
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,160
These are solar energy installations in the Pyrénées-Orientales.

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,620
Do you know it?

118
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,680
That's something.

119
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,920
I remember seeing it when I was little,

120
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,320
a solar furnace that liquefied metals in the blink of an eye.

121
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,500
Do you realize how much metal melts in the sun?

122
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,300
That stunned me.

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,940
You're bothering us with your steel industry.

124
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,240
Nobody cares.

125
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,820
Ah well, solar steelmaking,

126
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,160
I assure you there's something there, it's impressive.

127
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,640
Hey Marie-Laure, the doorbell rang, go see?

128
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:54,880
Yes

129
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,200
Marie-Laure will open the front door

130
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,060
It's the man in black

131
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:25,780
She comes back into the living room; no one paid much attention to what had happened.

132
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,120
What was it?

133
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,380
The sister's brother

134
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,120
Who ?

135
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,560
You know, the brother of the nun who came the other day

136
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
And what did he want?

137
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,280
He used to bring me back my gumballs

138
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,040
Had you lost them?

139
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,440
Non.

140
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,180
What were those gumballs he brought you?

141
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,940
They weren't mine, they were other gumballs.

142
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,240
But I don't understand any of it.

143
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
It's actually quite simple.

144
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,720
He told me, I'll bring you your gumballs.

145
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
But I saw that they weren't mine.

146
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,860
So I told him, no, they're not mine.

147
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,040
I gave it back to him, so he left.

148
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,760
But it's not very clear.

149
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,720
This whole business with the gumballs is quite mysterious.

150
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,260
Well, you, we can say you're not very talented, huh.

151
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,160
Everyone gets up to leave.

152
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,820
But it's 5 o'clock. I have to leave.

153
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,060
I'll accompany you.

154
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,160
Yes, I have to leave too.

155
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,620
Bye.

156
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,060
My phone.

157
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,720
Hi, Jean.

158
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,300
Robert is leaving too.

159
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,280
I'm going down too.

160
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,640
Where are you going?

161
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,280
In the garden.

162
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,860
Okay, fine, but you'll be back at 6 o'clock.

163
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,880
Do you hear? 6 o'clock sharp.

164
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,560
Mom and Dad aren't here tonight, so we'll eat early.

165
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,880
And if you're good, we'll go to the cinema.

166
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,680
Owl!

167
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,080
But six o'clock sharp, not a minute more.

168
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,380
Yes!

169
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,420
Colette arrives with a whole bunch of things in her arms.

170
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,000
She is loaded.

171
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,880
But you're carrying a lot of luggage, what are you bringing?

172
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,120
Mireille is also in charge here.

173
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
This lady is also in charge.

174
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,460
This one is also quite full.

175
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:29,060
This car is also loaded. Colette is bringing restaurant guides. The goémiot, the auto journal guide, the red Michelin guide which indicates hotels and restaurants with one, two and three stars.

176
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:35,300
And Jean-Michel brings the Michelin Green Guide, a tourist guide

177
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,160
Colette also brings a whole bunch of good things to eat

178
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,980
Small cakes, madeleines from Commercy in the East

179
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,320
Carpentras berlingots in Provence

180
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,440
Sweets and Cambrai sweets in the North

181
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,940
Montélimar nougat

182
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,440
in the Rhône Valley.

183
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,380
What is Montélimar's specialty?

184
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:03,900
Nougat.

185
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,320
And what is Cambrai's specialty?

186
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,980
The foolishness of Cambrai.

187
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,080
All of this is for Marie-Laure.

188
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,840
Colette spoils her.

189
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,860
Are you spoiling her a little too much?

190
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,940
Uncle Guillaume spoils her too.

191
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,420
Guillaume, you're spoiling her.

192
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,260
She is very close to her uncle

193
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,440
I can say that he spoils her a lot

194
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
All these good things are for Marie-Laure

195
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,200
But Colette hopes that Marie-Laure won't keep everything to herself.

196
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,060
I hope she'll let us taste a little of it

197
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,280
Snack, remember?

198
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
He tastes the wine

199
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,420
Among the courtly people, everyone tastes the wine in reverent silence.

200
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,380
He tastes the jam

201
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,500
Cécile tastes the raw salmon

202
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,140
He tastes the sauce

203
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,680
Here, have a taste!

204
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,700
Marie-Laure sets her conditions

205
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,280
If you take me with you, fine, otherwise I'll keep everything

206
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,860
She wants the others to take her with them

207
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,440
He takes the little boy away

208
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,300
She takes the little girl

209
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,040
But Mireille doesn't want to take Marie-Laure with her.

210
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,560
But come on Marie-Laure, you know very well that we can't take you

211
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,660
I don't care, if you don't want to take me, I'll go by myself.

212
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,620
I don't care, I don't care.

213
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,400
If you haven't finished your homework, you won't come to the cinema with us?

214
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,840
I don't care, I'll watch TV

215
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,400
Look at Jean-Claude, he doesn't care.

216
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,780
And look at the psychiatrist here

217
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,080
My mother wanted a daughter

218
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,620
He doesn't care

219
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,740
I don't care, if you don't want to take me, I'll go by myself.

220
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,820
And I won't say where I'm going, and you'll be in a real bind.

221
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,920
Marie-Laure talks about leaving all alone

222
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,320
This is ridiculous, she's talking nonsense.

223
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,140
But Marie-Laure, stop talking nonsense!

224
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,260
When I grow up, I want to be president of the republic.

225
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,900
But stop talking nonsense.

226
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,040
Well, it's not nonsense, it's good to be president of the republic

227
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,080
She's not serious, she talks nonsense.

228
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,360
It's a lady who would like to see a gentleman named Tasson

229
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,200
Tasson ?

230
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,620
I think she's in the wrong house

231
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,440
Not at all, Adette, don't talk nonsense.

232
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
No, you're talking nonsense, come on

233
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,760
No, it's not nonsense.

234
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,840
So let's go see, stop your nonsense and give everyone some candy

235
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,400
There you go, she's offering candy

236
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,200
What does my beloved convoy want?

237
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:53,740
You can offer sweets, you can offer flowers, perfume, cologne.

238
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,220
Have you changed your cologne?

239
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,760
Yeah, yeah.

240
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,300
Did you buy it? Then it was given to you as a gift.

241
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,780
Exactly, it was given to me as a gift.

242
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,700
A lady.

243
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,900
A lady.

244
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,280
Mireille suggests going to Ouessant.

245
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,740
Ouessant, Ouessant.

246
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:22,400
at sea, 20 km from the coast of Brittany, Hubert offers to explore France by boat; it's a

247
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:31,860
The idea is to tour France by boat. Robert thinks it's a joke. France by boat, that's me.

248
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:39,620
that you want to fool him, he thinks Hubert wants to fool him, to make fun of him, there is

249
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,620
It's your mom who's looking for you.

250
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,620
What? She's not at the office?

251
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,620
Is she at home?

252
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,620
Yes, indeed.

253
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,620
Oh really? And what's going on?

254
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
Okay, I'll go see.

255
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,620
That's not true. It's a joke.

256
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,620
It's easy to fool her.

257
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,620
She's a bit naive, isn't she?

258
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Marie-Laure likes to lead people on.

259
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,540
No, Hubert isn't making fun of Robert. He's serious.

260
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,800
No, no, it's completely serious.

261
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,460
No, I'm not joking.

262
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,280
He's serious. He's not joking.

263
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,060
Look, I got a 10 on my French homework.

264
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,420
You're kidding.

265
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,180
I'm not kidding, look.

266
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,400
She's not joking, that's true.

267
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,660
No, I'm not joking.

268
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,940
You can easily travel around France by boat.

269
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,860
Because there are many hills.

270
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,700
Imagine, 5000 kilometers of coastline.

271
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:50,980
That's a lot of beaches, we'll be able to swim every day.

272
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,160
Jean-Michel disagrees

273
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,520
No way.

274
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,620
Mom, can I go watch TV?

275
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,620
No way, do your homework.

276
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:08,580
Jean-Michel doesn't want to swim in the North Sea, nor in the English Channel.

277
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,760
It's too cold.

278
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,060
The gentleman is sensitive to the cold.

279
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,420
But my dear sir, in the USSR there are people who swim in January amidst icebergs and polar bears.

280
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,220
Jean-Michel is sensitive to the cold.

281
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,400
This Russian is not sensitive to the cold.

282
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,500
Marie-Laure thinks the Russians should have thermal suits.

283
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,740
Robert doesn't understand how one could travel around France by boat.

284
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,380
I can easily see how we could travel along the coast from Belgium to the Basque Country.

285
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,800
But to get from there to the Mediterranean, I see less clearly that, even if Louis XIV abolished the Pyrenees.

286
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:56,100
No problem, we go up the Garonne, then we take the Canal du Midi, yet another great achievement of Louis XIV by the way, and we arrive at the Mediterranean.

287
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:05,460
The Canal du Midi was built in the 17th century. It was a project of Louis XIV.

288
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,920
Another great achievement of Louis XIV, by the way.

289
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,320
In parentheses.

290
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,760
I acknowledge that you can go almost anywhere by boat, with all these rivers.

291
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,660
All these rivers.

292
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,960
All these channels.

293
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,000
There are four major rivers.

294
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,100
The Seine, which flows into the English Channel.

295
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:52,180
The Loire, which flows into the Atlantic, the Garonne, which also flows into the Atlantic, and the Rhône, which flows into the Mediterranean.

296
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,220
And then there are a whole bunch of rivers that flow into these rivers.

297
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,240
And there are still a whole bunch of canals

298
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,280
From the English Channel, one could go up the Seine.

299
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
Then the Marne

300
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,960
From the Marne, cross into the Saône via the canal

301
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,860
From the Saône, we pass into the Rhône

302
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,240
And we descend gently all the way to the Mediterranean

303
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,540
And we're going to eat bouillabaisse in Marseille.

304
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:31,940
There you have it, the real bouillabaisse from Marseille

305
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,280
Do you want the recipe?

306
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,000
But I'm thinking about it

307
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,880
My family has a small sailboat in Villequier.

308
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,300
Perhaps we could borrow it?

309
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,720
Wait a minute, I don't want to drown in the prime of my life.

310
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,560
Mireille is afraid of drowning

311
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,560
They too are afraid of drowning

312
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,520
Mireille is in the prime of her life

313
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,140
But her grandmother is no longer in the prime of her life.

314
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:04,380
Mireille explains to Marie-Laure why she doesn't want to go sailing in Villiquier.

315
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,480
You know, Victor Hugo?

316
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,060
Yes.

317
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,860
Well, he had a daughter.

318
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,200
Yes.

319
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,120
And that girl, she got married.

320
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:11,640
Yeah.

321
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,300
And one day, she went with her husband to Villiquier, on the Seine, to a family property.

322
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,840
And there was a boat, a sailboat.

323
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,760
and she went boating on the Seine with her husband

324
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,540
and the boat capsized and she drowned.

325
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,920
She didn't drown.

326
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,320
But Victor Hugo's daughter drowned.

327
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,800
And then Victor Hugo wrote a poem.

328
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,800
Jean-Michel doesn't want to go sightseeing on some rich kid's yacht.

329
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,920
Jean-Michel would feel guilty.

330
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,680
He too has a guilty conscience.

331
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,940
But Marie-Laure doesn't feel guilty.

332
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,760
Have you done your homework?

333
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,080
Non

334
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,360
And do you watch TV?

335
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,680
Yes

336
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,660
And you don't feel guilty?

337
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,080
Non

338
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,520
Jean-Michel wants to go see the real France

339
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,460
Working France

340
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,520
Steel mills, airplane and helicopter manufacturing

341
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,220
Michelin tires, Renault cars,

342
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,140
Finally, the France of the workers.

343
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,020
But, according to Hubert, it's not the workers

344
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,520
who manufacture Renault cars.

345
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,280
Oh no, and who do you think it is?

346
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,580
Robots!

347
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,940
These robots perform most of the assembly work.

348
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,720
Hubert, for his part, is very proud of the tidal power of the Rance.

349
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,940
near Mont-Saint-Michel,

350
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,020
a factory that harnesses the power of the tides

351
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,340
to produce electricity.

352
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,540
The Russians also have a tidal power plant

353
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,060
That they copied from ours

354
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,800
According to Hubert, they copied it from the French tidal power plant

355
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,460
But Jean-Michel disagrees; he is not convinced.

356
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,220
That's your voice

357
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,280
You're copying me because I draw better than you.

358
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,680
That's your voice

359
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,740
It's all obvious.

360
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,100
Hubert finds Jean-Michel ridiculous

361
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,260
And then you make me laugh with your hurricane marks.

362
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,280
And Jean-Michel finds Hubert ridiculous

363
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,720
You make me laugh with your tidal motor.

364
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,220
Jean-Michel thinks Hubert is a chauvinist.

365
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,900
It's impossible to be that chauvinistic.

366
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,040
That's not possible.

367
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,540
You take this candy and I'll take the others.

368
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,760
It's impossible to be that selfish.

369
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,620
Here, you can keep it.

370
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,360
Hubert is chauvinistic because he only appreciates French achievements.

371
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,100
Dear sir, please be aware that good wine can only be found in France.

372
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,760
He claims that all great inventions originated in France.

373
00:22:49,660 --> 00:23:05,860
Pasteurization, radioactivity, canned food, stethoscope, champagne, aviation, foie gras, love, freedom.

374
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:15,200
What impresses Jean-Michel are the solar energy installations in the Pyrénées-Orientales.

375
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,480
I remember seeing a solar furnace when I was little that liquefied metals in the blink of an eye.

376
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,200
If you heat a metal or glass, it liquefies.

377
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,860
Butter melts easily

378
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,940
Ice melts easily

379
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,480
Chocolate melts easily

380
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,560
But metals do not melt easily.

381
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,240
Do you realize how much metal melts in the sun?

382
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,020
That stunned me.

383
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,300
Stunned.

384
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,020
Look, he's stunned.

385
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,240
He too is stunned.

386
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,620
She is stunned.

387
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,240
What amazes Jean-Michel is solar-powered steelmaking.

388
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,040
The steel industry, the metals industry.

389
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,920
During this conversation, Marie-Laure receives a strange visit.

390
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,420
The brother of the good nun with the moustache.

391
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,900
What did he come here to do?

392
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,260
It's not very clear.

393
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,340
A story about a gumball.

394
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,920
Listen to Marie-Laure's explanation.

395
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,280
And then you will play the role of Mireille.

396
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,200
He used to bring me my gumballs.

397
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,600
Had you lost them?

398
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,140
Non.

399
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,740
What were those gumballs he brought you?

400
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,820
They weren't mine, they were other gumballs.

401
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,540
But I don't understand any of it.

402
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,740
Now it's your turn, you are Mireille.

403
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
What were those gumballs he brought you?

404
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,860
What were those gumballs he brought you?

405
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,100
What were those gumballs he brought you?

406
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,260
They weren't mine, they were other gumballs.

407
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
But I don't understand any of it.

408
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,060
But I don't understand any of it.

409
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,200
But I don't understand any of it.

410
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,140
And you, did you understand?

411
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,200
No, I didn't understand anything.

412
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,560
Well, you, we can say you're not very talented.

413
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,820
Me? Not talented?

414
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,700
That's the best one of the year.

415
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,400
Okay, let's see what you've understood.

416
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,280
Look, listen, think, and speak.

417
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:35,460
We gave you Cambray sweets, Carpentras berlingots, Montélimar nougat.

418
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,280
What needs to be done? We need to...

419
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,420
They need to be eaten.

420
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,440
Oh, that's so selfish. No, no, you have to...

421
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,140
To offer.

422
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,480
Who manufactures Renault cars?

423
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,280
Robots.

424
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,020
Your older sister and her friends don't want to take you on holiday with them.

425
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,260
What are you saying? What are you saying?

426
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,860
I don't care. If you don't want to take me, I'll go by myself.

427
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,700
Sir, look astonished.

428
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,400
Alright.

429
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,060
Have you seen what time it is?

430
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,500
Oh dear, it's late. I'm leaving.

431
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,980
I have to leave too.

432
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,420
Let's go.

433
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,080
What, let's leave?

434
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,940
They say, I have to leave.

435
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,000
What is this all about?

436
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,160
They say I'm leaving. I don't understand.

437
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,700
It's actually quite simple.

438
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,120
They say I'm leaving, but I have to leave.

439
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,780
I don't understand.

440
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,800
Well, you're not very good at it.

441
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,260
It's impossible to be that stupid.

442

Subtitles ST' 501
