3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,740
The Latin Quarter in Paris.

4
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,020
It's a beautiful spring morning.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,900
It is 11 o'clock.

6
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,100
It's May 29th.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,560
There is a student strike, obviously.

8
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,380
Robert, a young American, has just arrived in Paris.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,780
He is currently in the courtyard of the Sormone.

10
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,240
He smiled at a young girl.

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,960
Mireille, a young French woman studying art history,

12
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,980
is also in the courtyard of the Sormona.

13
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,740
She smiled at a young man.

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,340
Another young man crosses the Place de la Sormone.

15
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
He looks bored.

16
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,640
He approaches a young girl.

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,480
Excuse me, miss.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,880
Do you have a light, please?

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,940
Meanwhile, on the second floor of the Sorbonne, about ten students are waiting in front of an office.

20
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,340
A young man arrives.

21
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,400
Hey, it's the same one.

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,060
He assesses the situation and immediately heads towards Phil's head.

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,780
He approaches a young brunette girl wearing a purple dress.

24
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,120
Is that you? What are you doing here?

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,740
How have things been since last year?

26
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,560
The young girl looks at him in astonishment.

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,820
What, you don't recognize me?

28
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,420
But yes, come on, we were last in Saint-Tropez.

29
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,160
Me? In Saint-Tropez? Impossible.

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,640
First of all, I hate Saint-Tropez.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,220
Then there are the girls, the rich kids, and the idiots, that's really not my type.

32
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,540
And I hate summer.

33
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,680
I spend all my summers in Patagonia.

34
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,500
Because summer there is winter.

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,420
Elementary, my dear Watson.

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,260
You see, your thing with me, it doesn't work.

37
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,860
Voices are beginning to protest.

38
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,340
So, no cheating, eh?

39
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,360
No, the gatecrasher.

40
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,020
Ah, the queue!

41
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,600
But it's okay, I'll go to the back of the queue, if you can give me more pride.

42
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,580
And by the way, now, where are we going?

43
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,060
The young man will position himself at the end of the line.

44
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,740
He approaches a young girl wearing a green dress.

45
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,060
Excuse me, miss, do you have a light?

46
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,760
No, I don't smoke. Ask Jean-Luc.

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
And ?

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,040
There you go.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,060
He holds out his Bic lighter.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,320
THANKS.

51
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,060
My name is Jean-Pierre Bourdon. And you?

52
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
Jean-Luc Marchand.

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,040
And you ?

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,520
This is Annick. Her brother Philippe, Nadia, Ousmane, her friends.

55
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,120
What are you studying?

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,460
I study sociology and law.

57
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,600
Ah, you're right. Law can lead to anything.

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,240
And you ?

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,220
She's a math whiz.

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,980
Ah, yeah. That doesn't surprise me.

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,720
Today, all girls do math.

62
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,160
It's the new trend.

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,320
I have a friend who just started at Polytechnique.

64
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,580
But it's a brain, right?

65
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,760
She wants to specialize in computer science.

66
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,400
That's something that has a future, that's computer science.

67
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,700
Biology too, mind you.

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,660
Or astrophysics.

69
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,940
I don't really know what I'm going to do yet.

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,300
For now, I'm doing a master's degree in psychology.

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,740
I might study medicine.

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,300
Or... or psychoanalysis.

73
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,840
In any case, the psychologists are making a killing, that's for sure.

74
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,300
Or maybe I'll go to HEC, you know.

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,740
Or the IDEC.

76
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,120
You don't seem very settled, do you?

77
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,560
Oh, no.

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,600
I don't want to decide too young, it's too dangerous.

79
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,620
And how old are you, exactly?

80
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,300
Me? 29 years old, why?

81
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,860
Oh, nothing. Just like that.

82
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,060
You need to know.

83
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,060
Hey! Come see, come see! There's a great girl over there!

84
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,060
What ?

85
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
That's Gata Garbo's little girl.

86
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,060
Seriously, where?

87
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,060
There, there, in the courtyard on the right.

88
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Which one? The one with the white trousers, the blue and green blouse, and the scarf?

89
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
No, not that one, the other one next to it.

90
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,740
Oh, the blondes?

91
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,800
No, not the one with the white sweater and that horrible red prison skirt smiling like an idiot.

92
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,100
No, it's the popular one, the redhead, with the grey jeans and black jacket.

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,180
I know her, the redhead. She studies Russian at the language school.

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,500
But she's not Greta Garbo's granddaughter.

95
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,560
Ah good ?

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,340
Moreover, Greta Garbo had never had any children.

97
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,200
Oh, okay. In any case, it's still very good.

98
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,500
Look, there's a strange-looking guy approaching her

99
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,660
A guy with a black raincoat and a black hat

100
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,700
He's going to try to flirt with her, that's for sure.

101
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,520
There he goes, he asks her for a light

102
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,520
It's classic, it's even a bit basic

103
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,980
Yes, I think we can say that, this thing probably doesn't work very often.

104
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,200
And how do you go about starting a conversation?

105
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,760
I don't know, there are loads of things

106
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,240
There's no shortage of things

107
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,840
Okay, for example, you say, hey, that's you.

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,100
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,400
How have things been since last year?

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,640
Okay, the girl looks at you with a surprised expression.

111
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,020
What? You don't recognize me?

112
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,240
You don't remember me? Of course you do, last summer in Saint-Tropez,

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,240
or last winter in Courchevel, or in Patagonia.

114
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,320
Or last year in Marionne-Bade.

115
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,700
What? You're not... And you say a name.

116
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,680
Catherine Deneuve, Créta Garbeau, Jacqueline Dupont.

117
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:02,560
Nonsense, no, it's crazy how much you look like them then, but where is it that

118
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,740
You spend your holidays, well, that's something that works.

119
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,620
Either every time, or I don't know, you're just pretending to fall

120
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,120
in front of her on a staircase, or maybe, I don't know, you leave her there.

121
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,940
If papers fall in front of her, she helps you pick them up; you thank her and...

122
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,080
Here we go, all this isn't exactly new, we know it.

123
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,100
had nothing better

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,320
It's not going fast, is it? You've been waiting for a good half hour.

125
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:54,860
Oh darn it, I can't stay myself. I have a date with a gorgeous girl at school. I'm off.

126
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,280
The young man leaves.

127
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh my god, that guy stinks. A gorgeous girl, he sounds like he's talking about a horse.

128
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,240
Who does he think he is? What a horrible womanizer.

129
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,240
He imagines that girls are only there to fall into his arms, maybe.

130
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,900
He's not even handsome.

131
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,980
What an idiot.

132
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,120
It kills me, guys like that.

133
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,760
Well, he's not very clever, but he's harmless.

134
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,740
Well, that's it. Defend him.

135
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,020
You men are all the same, all equally sexist.

136
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,420
You're registered with the MLF now.

137
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,620
When I see guys like you, I really want to sign up, you know.

138
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,560
Okay, let's see now.

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,380
A young man crosses the boulevard

140
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,800
People are crossing the street

141
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,120
The bridge crosses the Seine

142
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,980
The young man crosses

143
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,060
This young man is Jean-Pierre, Jean-Pierre Bourdon

144
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,300
He's a womanizer

145
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,100
He tries to flirt with all the girls

146
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,680
Here, he's trying to flirt with Mireille.

147
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,960
Here, he's trying to pick up another girl

148
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,520
Here, he's trying to pick up another girl again.

149
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,600
He's a womanizer

150
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,500
This gentleman is also a womanizer

151
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,040
Jean-Pierre has several tricks for picking up girls.

152
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,720
Several systems

153
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,580
For example, he said

154
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,980
Hey, it's you, what are you doing here?

155
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,980
What, you don't recognize me?

156
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a thing, a system.

157
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,200
Uncle Guillaume knows a few things too.

158
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,440
I'm going to take your nose.

159
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,520
There you go.

160
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,860
For me, it's not my nose, it's something.

161
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,680
Jean-Claude has some tricks up his sleeve too.

162
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,540
Look.

163
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,660
It's a trick that works every time.

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,620
You'll see.

165
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,620
That's not right, is it?

166
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,340
You see, it's a good idea.

167
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,420
That works.

168
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,180
But in this case, it doesn't work.

169
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,120
This phone doesn't work.

170
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:21,380
One of Jean-Pierre's tricks for starting a conversation with a young girl is to ask her if she has a light.

171
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,120
Excuse me, miss, do you have a light, please?

172
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:50,620
That's a traffic light. She has a red light, an orange light, and a green light. Jean-Luc has a light. He has a lighter because he smokes. But Annick doesn't have a light because she doesn't smoke.

173
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,120
Excuse me, miss, do you have a light?

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,260
No, I don't smoke.

175
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:11,000
Look at that man, he's smoking. That woman is smoking too. And there's a tractor smoking. That's a fire smoking. That's smoke.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:24,580
About ten students are waiting outside an office at the Sorbonne. This is Mr. Bello's office at Renault. This is Mrs. Bello's office at the Ministry of Health.

177
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,120
These students are waiting

178
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,920
This lady is waiting, she's waiting for the bus

179
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,960
The bicycles are waiting for Mireille to have lunch

180
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,620
These gentlemen are waiting

181
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,520
They too are waiting

182
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,240
The students are waiting

183
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,160
They are queuing

184
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,740
They form a line

185
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,280
They are queuing

186
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,620
The front of the line, the tail

187
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,060
And there, the tip of the tail

188
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,860
Here's a finger and the tip of your finger

189
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,460
That's a street

190
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,320
And here's the end of the street

191
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,060
The students are queuing

192
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,020
They are waiting

193
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,480
It's not going fast

194
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,200
Now, yes, now it's going fast

195
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,600
Jean-Pierre arrive

196
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,640
He is examining the situation

197
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,240
He observes, he studies the situation

198
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,580
Here, Robert examines his map of Paris.

199
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,480
And then, Mireille examines the map

200
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320
And here's a doctor examining a patient.

201
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,920
And this gentleman is examining a procession of ants.

202
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,040
When Jean-Pierre moves towards the front of the line, voices begin to protest.

203
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,660
He doesn't cheat the system.

204
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,960
In line, like everyone else.

205
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,540
He's cutting in line because he's not going to the queue like everyone else.

206
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,560
He's cheating the system.

207
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,280
Look at this man.

208
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,320
He's cheating the system.

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,620
The French like to cheat the system.

210
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,660
Jean-Pierre Bourdon says there are many tricks to start a conversation

211
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,380
There are lots of things

212
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,220
There's no shortage of things

213
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,380
Finally, there's no shortage of things

214
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,260
Miss

215
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,700
Look here

216
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,560
Something is missing here.

217
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
Something is missing

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,320
What's missing?

219
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,360
Ah, the glasses

220
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,960
It's the glasses that are missing

221
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,420
Now, there's no shortage of glasses in France.

222
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,500
There's plenty of coffee. There's no shortage of cafes.

223
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,960
There are also many churches. There's no shortage of churches.

224
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,240
There are also many castles. There's no shortage of castles.

225
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,040
There's no shortage of things to do.

226
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,120
One of the tricks is to pretend to fall down a staircase.

227
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,280
And there we go, it's started.

228
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,020
A staircase, that's a staircase.

229
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,340
There's no shortage of stairs.

230
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,500
Obviously, you mustn't actually fall.

231
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,340
You have to pretend to fall.

232
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,980
You have to pretend like Mireille, remember?

233
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,500
She sees Jean-Pierre, but she pretends not to see him.

234
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,820
Here, Marie-Laure is pretending to be asleep.

235
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,360
Another trick is to drop papers in front of the girl.

236
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:10,000
The young girl helps you pick them up, you thank her, and there you go, off you go.

237
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,000
For that, you have to drop your papers.

238
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,460
Here, Jean-Pierre drops his papers.

239
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,640
Here, Marie-Laure drops the snack tray.

240
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,880
And this lady drops a statue.

241
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,400
But Jean-Pierre's big trick is to pretend to know the girl.

242
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,660
Hey, it's you. How have you been since last year?

243
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,200
You don't remember me? Of course you do.

244
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,900
Last summer in Saint-Tropez, or last winter in Courchevel, or in Patagonia, or last year in Marienbad.

245
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:53,640
Last summer, last winter, last year, last month.

246
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,340
Let's see.

247
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,120
If we are in May, then April was last month.

248
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,520
And June is next month.

249
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:12,240
Jean-Pierre pretends to have met the young girl last summer in Saint-Tropez.

250
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,360
Yes, of course, last summer in Saint-Tropez.

251
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,240
In Saint-Tropez? Why Saint-Tropez?

252
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,820
Well, because Saint-Tropez is very well-known, very chic

253
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,860
Everyone goes to Saint-Tropez

254
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,520
There are girls, rich kids who have money, yachts

255
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,540
In winter, everyone, well almost everyone, goes to Courchevel

256
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,320
Or perhaps, or perhaps in Patagonia

257
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,580
All of Jean-Pierre's stuff, it's all old stuff

258
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,580
It's not exactly new.

259
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,780
None of this is new, we're familiar with it.

260
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,040
But that, that, that's nothing new.

261
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,700
This is not a new house.

262
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,560
This house is not new.

263
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,380
None of this is new, we're familiar with it.

264
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,420
You have nothing better.

265
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,900
You have nothing better.

266
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,200
It's not very new.

267
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,560
Jean-Luc studies sociology.

268
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,420
He also practices law.

269
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,560
He is studying at the law school.

270
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,520
If you study law, you can become a lawyer, magistrate, judge.

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,880
The law leads to everything.

272
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,480
Ah, you're right. Law can lead to anything.

273
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,180
And this road leads to Montargis and Auxerre.

274
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,160
They say all roads lead to Rome.

275
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,540
And crime leads to prison.

276
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,240
I study sociology and law.

277
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,140
Ah, you're right.

278
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,580
He's right.

279
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,520
I'm going to bed.

280
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,440
Yes, you're right. Go to bed. Good night, my little one.

281
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,360
Good night.

282
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,700
Jean-Pierre's girlfriend is a math whiz. She's very intelligent.

283
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,440
Today, all girls are doing math. It's the new trend.

284
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,900
This is the new trend. Look.

285
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,480
But everyone is wearing dark glasses. It's the new fashion.

286
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:23,580
Jean-Pierre's girlfriend is a math whiz. She's very good at math. She's very intelligent. She's a brain.

287
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,160
And him, does he have a brain? No, he doesn't have a brain. He's all brawn, nothing in his head.

288
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:54,800
But Jean-Pierre's girlfriend, now that's a brain. She just got into IX, the Polytechnic School. Because she wants to specialize in computer science. She wants to work with computers. Or maybe astrophysics.

289
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:23,240
Jean-Pierre, on the other hand, studies psychology. He might go into medicine. To be a doctor, you have to study medicine. Or perhaps he'll become a psychoanalyst. Because psychoanalysts make a fortune. Psychoanalysts get paid a lot. They become rich.

290
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:33,980
Or perhaps he will go to HEC, the business school, to enter the world of business.

291
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,600
Or, he'll do IDEC, to become a filmmaker.

292
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:46,400
He hasn't made up his mind. He's hesitating. He can't decide, like Marie-Laure, look here.

293
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,300
I can't make up my mind.

294
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,600
Ben, make up your mind.

295
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,100
Jean-Pierre doesn't want to make a decision too young.

296
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,820
Because it's too dangerous

297
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,140
I don't want to decide too young, it's too dangerous.

298
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,740
Ice skating is dangerous too

299
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,400
Fencing is dangerous too

300
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,180
Very dangerous

301
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,260
And how old are you?

302
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,740
I'm 29 years old, why?

303
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,740
29 years old?

304
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,420
That's rather old for a student, isn't it?

305
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,580
Are you a student?

306
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,080
Yes, I'm at university.

307
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,980
How old are you ?

308
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,780
I am 21 years old.

309
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,220
Are you working?

310
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,180
No, I'm a student.

311
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,660
How old are you ?

312
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,300
I am 20 years old.

313
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,380
Okay, now it's your turn.

314
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,340
You will speak French.

315
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,220
Listen to this dialogue between the professor and the young girl.

316
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,700
Are you a student?

317
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,360
Yes, I'm at university.

318
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,940
Are you a student?

319
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,640
Yes, I'm at university.

320
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,460
Now it's your turn.

321
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
You are the young girl.

322
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,080
Answer.

323
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,080
Are you a student?

324
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,820
Yes, I'm at university.

325
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,880
How old are you ?

326
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,640
I am 21 years old.

327
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,500
What are your thoughts on psychoanalysis?

328
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Psychoanalysis is interesting.

329
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,820
In any case, the psychologists are making a killing, that's for sure.

330
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:20,600
– Jean-Luc and Jean-Pierre are trying to identify people based on what they are wearing.

331
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,880
There is a young girl wearing a purple dress.

332
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,520
That's a red skirt.

333
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,640
And these are blue pants.

334
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,240
That's a blouse.

335
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,340
And this is a shirt, a pink shirt.

336
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,520
A blouse for a woman and a shirt for a man.

337
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,040
This is a black jacket and this is a scarf.

338
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:57,140
The young girl wearing a black jacket and jeans is a redhead.

339
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,800
She's a redhead too. She speaks Russian.

340
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,780
Is she Russian?

341
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,440
No, she's not Russian, she's a redhead

342
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,480
She's a red-haired French woman who speaks Russian.

343
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,760
She studies Russian and Oriental languages.

344
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:25,020
She's a French redhead who speaks Russian

345
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,860
She's a redhead, but she's not Russian.

346
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,640
Yes, that's a Russian woman, a red-haired Russian woman.

347
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,900
Now, pay very close attention, look

348
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,860
That's a dark-haired Russian woman.

349
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,380
Jean-Pierre says that one of the young girls in the courtyard is Greta Garbo's granddaughter.

350
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,740
Which one? The one with the white trousers, the blue and green blouse, and the scarf?

351
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,340
No, not that one, the other one next to it.

352
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,900
Look. Which one is it?

353
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,220
This one? That one?

354
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,900
The one wearing a skirt?

355
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,260
The one with the blue sweater?

356
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
The one next door?

357
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,720
Jean-Pierre leaves because he feels the queue isn't moving fast enough.

358
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,940
It's not going fast, is it?

359
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,940
How long have you been waiting?

360
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,740
A good half hour.

361
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,220
Oh darn it, I can't stay myself.

362
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,740
I have a date with a gorgeous girl at school.

363
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,900
Well, I'm out of here.

364
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,200
He doesn't stay, he leaves, he runs away.

365
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,760
Observe what Marie-Laure says here.

366
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,940
Are you coming?

367
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,780
No, I'm staying.

368
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,800
Okay, whatever you want.

369
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,680
Marie-Laure remains in Luxembourg.

370
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,480
Jean-Pierre is not staying because he has an appointment.

371
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,460
Here's a date.

372
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,140
That's a business meeting.

373
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,940
And that's a date.

374
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,420
Annick doesn't find Jean-Pierre very nice.

375
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,800
She finds it smelly.

376
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,560
Oh dear, that guy stinks.

377
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,740
It stinks. It stinks.

378
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,260
Oh dear, it stinks in here!

379
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,000
But what smells so bad?

380
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,040
It's that cheese that stinks.

381
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,980
Oh my god, that guy stinks!

382
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Who does he think he is?

383
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,360
This Jean-Pierre fancies himself a Don Juan.

384
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,580
Here, look at this

385
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,680
That's Napoleon

386
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,680
And that's Robert, who thinks he's Napoleon.

387
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,980
That's Louis XIV

388
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,020
That's Robert, thinking he's Louis XIV.

389
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,940
He imagines that the girls are there to fall into his arms, maybe.

390
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,320
What an idiot.

391
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,220
It kills me, guys like that.

392
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,500
It's killing me.

393
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,780
Ah, it kills me, guys like that.

394
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,440
Well, Phil isn't very bright, but he's harmless.

395
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,680
That's a harmless animal.

396
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,500
But this is not a harmless animal.

397
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
Ah, you men are all the same.

398
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,520
Ah, you men are all the same.

399
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,660
Hey, you're registered with the MLF now.

400
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,220
MLF, Movement for the Liberation of Women.

401
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,280
Okay, look at this young man. What is he doing?

402
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,700
He's trying to flirt with Mireille.

403
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,540
Does it work?

404
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:45,700
Non.

405
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,280
And now, look at this young man.

406
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,860
Hey, it's you! What are you doing here?

407
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,720
How have things been since last week?

408
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,300
Oh, you have a very pretty red skirt.

409
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,120
You don't recognize me?

410
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,480
Oh, I'd kill guys like that.
