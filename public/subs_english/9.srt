Subtitling by Radio-Canada

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,680
Yes, you know the person in Georges' portrait from earlier.

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:44,560
The slender hands, the blue eyes, the blond hair, the entire portrait of his second daughter.

6
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
You're bothering us.

7
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,120
But I want to know who it is.

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, look at Mireille. Doesn't she look distinguished?

9
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,560
Yes.

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,220
Does she have delicate hands?

11
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,600
Yes.

12
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,480
Does she have blue eyes?

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,720
Yes.

14
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,180
Does she have blonde hair?

15
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,460
Yes.

16
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,660
So, this is Mireille.

17
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,640
Can you be stupid?

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,660
Listen, the whole picture of her second daughter, does Mireille have any daughters?

19
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,140
Well no.

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,620
So, it's not Mireille.

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,480
She is someone who has a daughter, who looks distinguished, with slender hands, blue eyes, and blond hair, like Mireille.

22
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,540
So, it's Mom.

23
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,980
That's it.

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:25,920
Ah.

25
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,420
So, shall we continue?

26
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,480
Oh, that's enough.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,620
Oh no, I like it. It's difficult, but it's fun.

28
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,720
Okay, so, listen.

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,180
His right eye is looking towards Brest.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,580
His left eye is looking towards Bordeaux.

31
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,620
Oh dear, isn't she mean?

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,040
Poor Uncle Victor, he's hardly cross-eyed.

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,620
So, who is it?

34
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,260
Uncle Victor.

35
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,920
For what ?

36
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,720
Because Uncle Victor relaxes a little, his eyes are not looking in exactly the same direction, that's all.

37
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,060
Okay, my turn now.

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:14,880
He has a straight nose, always clean-shaven, he even has a shaved head, probably to hide the fact that he's going to be bald.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,960
Uncle Henri, your portrait is too easy.

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,500
Drink me now.

41
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,020
A bit of a mustache, a big mouth, but no chin.

42
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,940
And she always talks about her late husband.

43
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,200
Ah, back in the days of my poor husband.

44
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,420
No need to continue, it's Aunt Amélie.

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,540
Your portraits are all too simplistic.

46
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,980
I'll do the next one.

47
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,860
Warning, this is going to be more difficult.

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,960
Protruding ears,

49
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,080
large glasses,

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,900
an enormous beard

51
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,100
drooping mustaches,

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,600
and above all

53
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,240
an enormous nose.

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,800
Monumental.

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,100
Your little man isn't very handsome.

56
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,620
I don't see

57
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,500
From stone, our math teacher

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,440
Oh, but that's not fair.

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,340
We don't know your math teacher.

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,520
He is not related

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,360
Luckily he's not related

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,200
He's as dumb as a doorknob

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,180
And there's nothing more cowish

64
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,640
Well, I think that's enough.

65
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,300
We've been playing this stupid game for two hours.

66
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,320
What are we showing at the film club tonight?

67
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,560
Hey Marie-Laure, look in the newspaper

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,800
What am I watching?

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,500
What's showing at the cinema tonight? Are you deaf or something?

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,060
See if there are any new movies.

71
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,800
Tonight, we're playing Claire's genius.

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,540
Claire's genius? What's that all about?

73
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,560
But you can't read? It's not Claire's genius, it's Claire's knee, you idiot.

74
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,100
By Eric Romère. Everyone knows this, it's an old film.

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,180
Claire's knee, Claire's knee. It has to be said, it's a strange title.

76
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,180
And why not Claire's foot, or Claire's ankle, or Claire's toe.

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Hi everyone. So what are you doing?

78
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,040
It hasn't rained for an hour.

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,560
It's not raining anymore?

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,140
Oh no?

81
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,440
Not possible.

82
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,240
Yes, yes, I assure you, it's rising.

83
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,420
So, are you coming to go sailing?

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,280
No, old man, not today. Today we're taking a nap.

85
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,640
Wait for me, Jean-Denis. I'll come, if you want.

86
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,120
Oh là là, those sporty ones!

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,340
Hey, we'd chain you up, that's fine.

88
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,240
Mireille, her sisters and her cousins ​​are playing portrait game to pass the time.

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,540
When you have nothing to do, you have to pass the time.

90
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,320
To pass the time, one can read.

91
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,380
To pass the time, you can watch television.

92
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,820
To pass the time, you can play cards.

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
Time passes.

94
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,020
When you have nothing to do, when you're bored, time passes slowly.

95
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,340
But when you're having fun, time flies.

96
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,980
Time passes, time gone by

97
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,800
There are two times, two kinds of time

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
Time passing

99
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,940
And the weather

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,940
For example, the weather here is bad

101
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,300
The weather is nice here.

102
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,400
The weather is bad, the weather is nice

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
The weather is bad, it's raining.

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,560
Now it's not raining anymore

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,740
It's rising.

106
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,640
And now, the weather is nice.

107
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,520
The weather is bad.

108
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,280
It's rising.

109
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,440
The weather is nice.

110
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,300
It's rising.

111
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,380
Georges painted a portrait.

112
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,760
A distinguished air, slender hands, blue eyes.

113
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,700
But Marie-Laure doesn't guess who it is.

114
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,700
She wants to know who it is.

115
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,640
So she asks.

116
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,060
So who is it?

117
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,620
Mom, who is that?

118
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,520
So who is it?

119
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,720
Now, observe what Jean-Denis says

120
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,500
And who is this?

121
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,520
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

122
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,240
Now, observe this small scene

123
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,520
Who is that?

124
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,520
Who is that?

125
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,520
Who is it ?

126
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,780
Who is it?

127
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:47,660
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? It's all the same! So, who is it?

128
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,580
But I don't know! Mom, who is that?

129
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,880
Who is it ?

130
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,000
That's your great-grandfather, Adolphe Bélot.

131
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,620
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

132
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,280
Mireille is painting a portrait of Uncle Victor. Uncle Victor is cross-eyed.

133
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
I'm cross-eyed too. Look.

134
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,580
Yes, but Uncle Victor is different.

135
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,000
He has one eye looking towards Brest and the other towards Bordeaux, on the Bordeaux side, in the direction of Bordeaux.

136
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,740
Towards Bordeaux, on the Bordeaux side, in the direction of Bordeaux.

137
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,920
Uncle Henri has a straight nose.

138
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,340
That's a straight nose.

139
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,640
A hook, a hooked nose.

140
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,400
A straight nose

141
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,400
A hooked nose

142
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,980
Uncle Henri has a shaved face

143
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,300
He's not shaved there.

144
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,860
There, he is shaved

145
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,860
He has no beard, he has a shaved chin.

146
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,500
Here, he's shaved, but he's badly shaved.

147
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,820
This gentleman is also unshaven.

148
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,340
But this gentleman is clean-shaven.

149
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,420
This gentleman is also clean-shaven.

150
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,740
He is always very well shaved.

151
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,400
He too is always very well shaved, closely shaved.

152
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,180
And he even has a shaved head.

153
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,600
Uncle Henry is going to be bald.

154
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,780
This gentleman is bald.

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,020
This gentleman is also bald.

156
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,740
The gentleman on the right is not bald.

157
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,740
The gentleman on the left is not bald.

158
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,200
But the man in the middle is bald.

159
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Uncle Henri has a shaved head.

160
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,860
He shaves his head because he wants to hide the fact that he's going to be bald.

161
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,280
Look at Marie-Laure here. She wants to hide her chocolates.

162
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,160
What are you doing ?

163
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm hiding my chocolates.

164
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,380
For what ?

165
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,420
Because Mireille eats them all.

166
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,180
She's hiding something behind her back here.

167
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,520
Aunt Amélie has a bit of a moustache.

168
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:13,300
A little moustache, a lot of moustache, a huge moustache, drooping moustaches.

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,180
Asterix has drooping moustaches.

170
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,760
Aunt Amélie has no chin.

171
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,920
He has a big chin, a round chin.

172
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
Aunt Amélie always talks about her deceased husband.

173
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,460
Her husband is deceased, he is dead.

174
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:39,240
When she talks about her husband, she always says, "My poor husband, because he's dead."

175
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,940
When Mireille paints a portrait of Aunt Amélie, Georges says, "No need to continue, that's Aunt Amélie."

176
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:52,520
There's no point in continuing. He knows who it is, he's guessed. There's no point in continuing. Listen.

177
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,520
What are you looking for?

178
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,660
My Asterix.

179
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,680
There's no need to look for it, Mom reads it.

180
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,200
Now listen to what Mireille is going to say

181
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,720
Stop

182
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,780
Stop

183
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm telling you to stop

184
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:21,420
There's no point in crying now

185
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,700
Too bad for you, it's your fault

186
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,040
Now listen to what Marie-Laure is going to say

187
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,860
Marie-Laure

188
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,140
Marina

189
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,960
There's no need to shout.

190
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
I am not deaf

191
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Georges painted the following portrait

192
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,340
Look

193
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,720
Here is a number

194
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,680
That's 5

195
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,640
The next number is 6

196
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,000
The next number is 7

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,940
And the next number is 8

198
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,880
And so on

199
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,200
Next, next

200
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,340
The next number

201
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,160
The next house

202
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,560
Georges paints a portrait of his math teacher, his mathematics teacher.

203
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,240
He has protruding ears.

204
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,500
Those are ears glued on.

205
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,020
And there you have it, protruding ears.

206
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,000
Glue.

207
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,940
This new baby at the English court does not have his father's protruding ears.

208
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,980
The math teacher has ears.

209
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,980
I have ears too.

210
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,040
Everyone has ears.

211
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,280
Even doors have ears.

212
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,220
He also wears glasses.

213
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,140
He wears glasses too.

214
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,040
Large glasses.

215
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,160
Large black glasses.

216
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
He also has a big nose.

217
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,060
A huge, enormous nose, like Cyrano's nose.

218
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,640
A monumental nose.

219
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,280
A nose as big as a monument, like the Eiffel Tower, for example.

220
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,560
That's a big nose, a monumental nose.

221
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,420
With his big nose, Georges' math teacher isn't good

222
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,820
Besides, he's stupid, as dumb as a doorknob.

223
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,180
The head is intelligent

224
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,120
But feet aren't intelligent, they're stupid, dumb.

225
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,300
The head decides and the feet follow, foolishly, stupidly.

226
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,280
The math teacher is as dumb as a doorknob

227
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,320
And what's more, he's a cow, he's mean

228
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,480
That's a cow

229
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:42,320
The math teacher is a jerk. People usually say that police officers are jerks. Georges' math teacher is a jerk, a real jerk, extremely a jerk. He couldn't be more of a jerk. He's the absolute worst.

230
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,560
Look. These are protruding ears. These are very protruding ears.

231
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,560
And those are ears, you couldn't find any more prominent.

232
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,200
With his big nose and protruding ears, the math teacher isn't very handsome. He's a strange fellow.

233
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,620
Your little man isn't very handsome. Your little man isn't very handsome.

234
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:09,560
A man, a gentleman, a fellow, a funny fellow, a little fellow.

235
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:18,520
A Santa Claus, a snowman, a funny little man

236
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:26,140
When Georges says that it's her math teacher, Mireille is not happy, she protests.

237
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, but that's not fair, oh, but that's not fair

238
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,740
When you play a game, you have to follow the rules of the game.

239
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,360
When you play the portrait game, you have to choose someone everyone knows; that's the rule of the game.

240
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,760
But Mireille doesn't know Georges' math teacher.

241
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,380
Cécile doesn't know him either.

242
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,500
Yvonne doesn't know him either.

243
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,240
We don't know your math teacher.

244
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,580
Look at Mireille here

245
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,020
Hello, Miss Bello, how are you?

246
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,720
I'm fine, thank you, and you, are you well?

247
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,440
She knows this professor

248
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,340
More...

249
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,820
I can ?

250
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,860
Yes, you can.

251
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,640
THANKS

252
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,680
Aunt Georgette doesn't know him

253
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,980
Aunt Georgette doesn't know many people

254
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,900
Hello, Osman

255
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,640
Are you doing well ?

256
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,500
Yes, you're fine.

257
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,080
Mireille knows a lot of people, she knows a lot of people, she is very sociable.

258
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,420
She knows people.

259
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,740
She knows a lot of people.

260
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,700
Hi how are you ?

261
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,240
I'm fine, thank you, and you?

262
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,960
Mireille knows a lot of people, but she doesn't know Georges' math teacher.

263
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,040
Cécile doesn't know him either.

264
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,120
Marie-Laure doesn't know him either.

265
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,520
Yvonne doesn't know him either.

266
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,280
We don't know your math teacher.

267
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,940
We don't know your math teacher.

268
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,440
Who is it? We.

269
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:47,300
We are Mireille, Yvonne, Cécile, or Marie-Laure, or Uncle Guillaume, or Balzac, or Mr. Bello, or Mrs. Bello, well, we are anyone.

270
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,180
In France, we speak French.

271
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,460
Who speaks French in France?

272
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,800
Well, everyone, people in general.

273
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,440
We speak French.

274
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,160
We speak French, people speak French, we speak French.

275
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,380
Mireille wants to go to the cinema.

276
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,900
She wants to go see a movie.

277
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,760
Hey, what are we showing at the film club tonight?

278
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,740
She wants to go to the cinema because it's raining, there's nothing to do, and she finds the game of portraits boring.

279
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,740
Well, I think that's enough.

280
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,400
We've been playing this stupid game for two hours.

281
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,140
She thinks it's a silly, idiotic, stupid, boring game.

282
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,920
We've been playing this stupid game for two hours.

283
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,840
It's been two hours.

284
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,980
We've been playing portrait for two hours.

285
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,200
It has been raining for three days.

286
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,740
We've been playing for two hours, and it's been raining for three days.

287
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,980
On that day, we don't show a new film, we play Claire's knee.

288
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,080
This is not a new film, it's an old film.

289
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,860
Yes, that's a new film, it's new.

290
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,540
Listen.

291
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,760
It's a new sweater.

292
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,280
What sweater?

293
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,900
No, it's old, I've had it for two years.

294
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,720
But you have a new skirt.

295
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,160
This skirt?

296
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,520
I've had it for three years.

297
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,160
A new sweater, a new skirt. New, new.

298
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,360
We're not playing a new film, we're playing an old film called Claire's Knee.

299
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:21,820
The knee, the ankle, the foot, the toe, the leg.

300
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:32,680
The right leg, the right foot, the left leg, the left foot, the left foot, the left leg.

301
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,560
The right foot, the right leg.

302
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,980
The left arm, the right arm.

303
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,500
And that's the Venus de Milo.

304
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,160
She has no arms.

305
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,960
She has no right arms, nor does she have left arms.

306
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,900
Okay, now we're going to do a portrait.

307
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,940
Let's see if you can guess who it is.

308
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,120
That big nose, that big beard,

309
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,800
those drooping mustaches,

310
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,760
Her protruding ears, her large glasses

311
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,080
Who is it ?

312
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,760
Do you see? Can you guess?

313
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,260
But that's Georges' math teacher.

314
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,380
This fellow isn't very handsome.

315
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,300
Professor of Stone

316
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,320
Okay, now, observe what Jean-Di says.

317
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,760
It hasn't rained for an hour.

318
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,980
It's not raining anymore

319
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,920
Oh no?

320
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,240
Not possible

321
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,920
Yes, yes, I assure you, it's rising.

322
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,940
Not possible

323
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, yes, I assure you

324
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,260
Observe

325
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,660
It's possible

326
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,120
Yes, it's possible.

327
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,440
That's not possible

328
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,040
Yes, it's possible.

329
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,720
It's possible

330
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,700
Yes

331
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
That's not possible

332
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,240
And

333
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,960
Observe

334
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,420
I don't look distinguished.

335
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,560
And

336
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,840
I don't have blue eyes.

337
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
And

338
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,360
Now, observe

339
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,640
It's not my fault

340
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,280
Yes, it's your fault, you idiot.

341
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,160
You never pay attention to anything

342
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
No, it's not my fault

343
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,480
Yes, it's your fault

344
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,260
Non

345
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,880
And

346
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,240
It's not my fault

347
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,040
Yes, it's your fault

348
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,540
Now, look at this other scene.

349
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,620
Is anyone there?

350
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,940
No, there's nobody here.

351
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,720
Oh, if there's anyone

352
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,400
If there is anyone

353
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
Another example

354
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,040
It's my turn to play

355
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,900
Yes, it's yours.

356
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,420
No, it's not hers.

357
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Yes, it's hers.

358
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,100
No, it's not hers.

359
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,260
Yes, it's hers.

360
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,140
Non

361
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,640
And

362
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,400
Non

363
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,980
And

364
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,380
It's mine

365
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,860
Yes, it's yours.

366
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,220
It's not mine.

367
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,820
Yes, it's yours.

368
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,120
Observe.

369
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,900
Whose turn is it?

370
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,160
It's your turn.

371
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,180
Is this mine?

372
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,160
No, it's not hers.

373
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,420
So whose is it then?

374
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,820
It's his.

375
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,580
It's mine.

376
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,940
It's ours.

377
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,460
It's your turn.

378
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,340
It's up to you.

379
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,380
It belongs to Georges.

380
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,120
It's his.

381
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,840
It belongs to Georges and Mireille.

382
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,680
It's up to them.

383
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,560
It belongs to Cécile.

384
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,180
It's hers.

385
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,080
It belongs to Cécile and Mireille, it belongs to her.

386
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:08,720
To me, to you, to him, to her, to us, to you (plural), to them, to her.

387
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,180
Yeah! Your turn!

388
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,940
It's stopped raining. The sun is rising.

389
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,520
Jean-Denis suggests going sailing.

390
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,180
So, are you coming to go sailing?

391
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,000
So, are you coming to go sailing?

392
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,340
No, old man, not today.

393
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,860
Today, we're taking a nap.

394
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,600
Listen.

395
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,980
So, are you coming?

396
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm coming, I'm coming.

397
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,040
I'm coming, you're coming, we're all coming.

398
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,220
She comes, he comes, they come

399
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,180
We come, you come.

400
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,020
So, are you coming?

401
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,460
I'm coming, I'm coming.

402
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,480
Oh la la!

403
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,960
Okay, I'll wait.

404
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,360
Waiting, I'm waiting,

405
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,860
You wait, he waits,

406
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,440
"We wait, you wait, they wait."

407
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,200
"You're going to call him. No, wait, wait. So, are you coming to go sailing?"

408
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,240
"No, old man, not today. Today we're taking a nap."

409
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,620
"Wait for me, Jean-Denis. I'll come, if you like."

410
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:20,620
"Wow, what an athlete! Here, take your raincoat, you'll feel better."

411
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,940
Mireille throws a raincoat to Cécile.

412
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,860
Sailors wear oilskins, but so do tourists.

413
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,680
When it rains, you need to take an umbrella.

414
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,760
That's better.

415
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,220
It's raining, everyone inside.

416
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,040
Everyone inside.

417
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,060
When it rains, it's best to have a raincoat.

418
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,720
You should take a raincoat, it's better that way.

419
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,060
It's best to wear a raincoat.

420
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,860
When it rains, what is the best thing to do?

421
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,340
Go sailing or play at being a portrait artist?

422
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,580
It's better to play at portraiture.

423
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,480
When the weather is nice, what is the best thing to do?

424
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,820
Going to the cinema or going sailing?

425
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,140
It's better to go sailing.

426
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,440
When it rains, is it better to go to the cinema or go sailing?

427
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,700
It's better to go to the cinema.

428
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,500
Let's see now.

429
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,320
It's raining and you want to go to the cinema.

430
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,640
Are you taking an umbrella?

431
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,040
Yes, that's better.

432
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,300
It's raining and you want to go sailing.

433
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,660
Are you taking a raincoat?

434
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,680
Yes, that's better.

435
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,760
The weather's bad, what are you going to do?

436
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,560
Are you going mountaineering, rock climbing, or are you going to play cards?

437
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,680
It's better to play cards, yes, it's better.

438
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,660
Now you are going to speak French

439
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,180
Listen to this dialogue between Jean-Denis and Georges

440
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,700
And you will repeat Georges' answers.

441
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,420
Hi everyone!

442
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,960
So, what are you doing?

443
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,100
It hasn't rained for an hour.

444
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,380
It's not raining anymore?

445
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,600
Non

446
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,820
That's not possible

447
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,080
Yes, yes, I assure you

448
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,100
It's rising

449
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,760
So, are you coming to go sailing?

450
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,060
No, old man, not today.

451
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,560
Today, we're taking a nap.

452
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,540
Now it's your turn, you are Georges.

453
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,280
Hi everyone!

454
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,820
So, what are you doing?

455
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,920
It hasn't rained for an hour.

456
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,560
It's not raining anymore?

457
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,820
It's not raining anymore?

458
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,980
It's not raining anymore?

459
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,160
Non.

460
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,460
That's not possible.

461
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,900
That's not possible.

462
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,360
That's not possible.

463
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,600
Yes, yes, I assure you.

464
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,620
It's rising.

465
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,680
So, are you coming to go sailing?

466
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,040
No, old man, not today.

467
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,040
No, old man, not today.

468
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,000
No, old man, not today.

469
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,500
Today, we're taking a nap.

470
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,680
Today, we're taking a nap.

471
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,000
Today, we're taking a nap.

472
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,080
Okay, now let's see what you remember.

473
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,380
What's the weather like here?

474
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,200
It's raining.

475
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
And what's the weather like here?

476
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Is the weather bad?

477
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,080
No, the weather is nice.

478
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,240
And is the weather bad here?

479
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,680
No, it's rising.

480
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,000
Does this man have a hooked nose?

481
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,440
No, he has a straight nose.

482
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,440

No, he doesn't have a beard, he has a shaved chin.

490
