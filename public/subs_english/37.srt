00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,320
black shoes, he also has one black sock, but the other one is red

5
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,000
He placed a pair of dark glasses next to his cup of black coffee, of course.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,860
He blinks one eye, then the other, then both; this tic irritates Mireille tremendously.

7
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,760
who will get up and leave when she sees Robert sitting on the terrace of the café across the street

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,020
He looks nervously around him to the right, to the left.

9
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,860
He looks at his watch

10
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,880
Then he looks up and suddenly seems to discover that there's a café opposite.

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,460
He springs up, leaps, and takes a few steps forward.

12
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,780
He stops, goes back, throws a bill on the table

13
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,900
He takes off running again, dashing down the boulevard without looking right or left.

14
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,880
A screeching brake, a resounding but incomprehensible curse

15
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,360
Mireille closed her eyes. When she opened them, Robert was sitting next to her.

16
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,060
I'm not on the train, am I?

17
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,020
No, no. Anyway, it doesn't start for another two hours. Do you want to go?

18
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,820
Okay, let's go.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,480
Okay, let's go.

20
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,020
1:50 pm, in front of the cinema.

21
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,040
Two seats, please.

22
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,500
Wait, I have my student card.

23
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,700
A student seat please, that's 64 francs, but you have to

24
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,860
You were waiting a bit, it's not open yet, it's a shame that we

25
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,940
We couldn't come on Monday, why? Because it's cheaper on Mondays.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,720
There you go, you can come in, thank you, thank you. An usher takes their ticket and their

27
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,540
indicates that seats here will be fine, it's not a bit too far from the screen, so here

28
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:57,620
THANKS

29
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,740
You have the tickets, she gave them back to you, yes, but you heard what she said

30
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,980
Thank you, her turn wasn't very kind, by the way, why did she thank me?

31
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,160
I didn't give her anything, but that's precisely why she expected us to give each other.

32
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,440
A tip? Oh really? You have to tip the ushers? Well, yes, it's the custom. I don't

33
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,760
I didn't know, you should have told me, why didn't you tell me, how do you expect me to

34
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:30,440
Just so you know, I'm not aware of it, it's not a big deal. When is it going to start?

35
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:39,380
How soon will it be? Just a little patience.

36
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,940
The lights go out, we switch from advertising to commercials.

37
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,940
café

38
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:57,200
But this coffee opens the way to the great coffees of Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.

39
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,920
Colombia is home to some of the world's finest coffees.

40
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,480
Having descended from the high plateaus, they crossed the mountains, traversed the valleys.

41
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Today, here they are in Escafé, pure Colombia.

42
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:24,120
Delicate and fragrant, pure Arabica, with a powerful aroma.

43
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,720
Pure Colombia, pure Arabica, two great coffees by Nescafé.

44
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,320
A windsurfing board.

45
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,700
Starfish.

46
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,740
Bic Marine. Windsurfing boards for everyone.

47
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,700
Toothpaste.

48
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Time. A razor. Bic, the razor that doesn't come apart. Simple as Bic. Cognac.

49
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:24,100
French subtitles?

50
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,000
Rémi Martin, fine champagne cognac, exclusively.

51
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
Mineral water.

52
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,720
Vitelle, you are rediscovering the vitality that is within you.

53
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,880
An electronic typewriter.

54
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,340
She was circling around me, I was scared.

55
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,460
At the same time, she attracted me.

56
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
I couldn't talk to anyone about it.

57
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,220
Do you want to know how I wrote "A Thousand Ways to Accommodate an Atom"?

58
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,840
With my P44 brush.

59
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,500
Not the end of the tunnel?

60
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,100
Non.

61
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,140
Ultra-lightweight, completely silent.

62
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,780
Vitelle, my mother wanted a daughter.

63
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:45,120
And finally, candy.

64
00:08:51,780 --> 00:09:20,780
...

65
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:50,760
Soft music

66
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,060
Tender and spicy. For sale in this room.

67
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,600
At that precise moment, the lights come back on and the ushers become saleswomen.

68
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,960
Ask in the room, sweets and ice creams.

69
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,580
Mademoiselle.

70
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,160
All that is very good, but that's not why I came.

71
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,860
I came to see love in the afternoon.

72
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,560
Yes, it will come. You just need to be a little patient, come on.

73
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,940
Indeed, the lights go out.

74
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,880
I don't think it would ever start.

75
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,180
Hey, you'll have to explain it to me if I don't understand.

76
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,240
Promise?

77
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,460
I'll draw you a little picture.

78
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,000
And be quiet now.

79
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,200
Aren't those two going to shut up anytime soon?

80
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,680
Because there are some ill-mannered people out there, after all.

81
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,840
The film tells the story of a man in his thirties,

82
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,480
A young, dynamic, friendly, married executive

83
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,340
He meets a young, somewhat bohemian woman.

84
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,180
Whom he knew before his marriage

85
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,900
And who decides to seduce him?

86
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,880
He meets several times in the afternoon

87
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,780
He is tempted, but at the last moment

88
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,220
He escapes

89
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,180
He returns to his wife's love

90
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,820
In the afternoon, of course.

91
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,600
Finally, all of this is very moral.

92
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,580
All's well that ends well, as my Aunt Georgette says.

93
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,980
So, where are we?

94
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,900
We are in Montparnasse, on the terrace of the Rotonde.

95
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,320
Mireille attend.

96
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,660
Who ?

97
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,640
Robert, obviously.

98
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,660
He's not here.

99
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,960
He is late.

100
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,060
They had an appointment at 1:30.

101
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:50,680
It's a quarter to two. Robert is late. What's he doing? He must be lost.

102
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,760
At a table near Mireille's, there is a gentleman in his fifties.

103
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,200
Around fifty years old? No, no, he's not fifty, no. He, yes, he must be in his fifties.

104
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,240
How old are you? Almost fifty.

105
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:16,960
But him, no, he's certainly not in his fifties, no, maybe in his forties, his thirties, between 30 and 40 years old, let's say.

106
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:26,500
And so, this gentleman is strange. He's strange because he's all in black, he's dressed entirely in black.

107
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:36,140
He has a black hat, he has a black ruffle, he also has a black suit, a suit, trousers and a jacket.

108
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,660
Look, he's wearing a suit, a jacket and trousers.

109
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,760
This gentleman also has a black raincoat.

110
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,840
A raincoat for the rain, an odd one out.

111
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,860
He too is wearing an odd number, and so is she.

112
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,140
He too is wearing an odd number.

113
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,600
And he removes his odd number.

114
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,960
The man also has black shoes.

115
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,860
Shoes.

116
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,820
That's a shoe store.

117
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,780
He buys shoes in a shoe store.

118
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,800
He buys shoes too.

119
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,160
She too is trying on shoes.

120
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,340
Look.

121
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,520
Jeanne, what is it?

122
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,360
It's definitely a shoe store.

123
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,440
The strange man has black shoes.

124
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,920
He also has black socks.

125
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,140
A sock.

126
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,220
Shoes.

127
00:13:38,240 --> 00:14:02,360
Socks. This gentleman has black socks. Actually, he only has one black sock, because the other is red. Strange, strange. He has a black mustache, black hair. And he also has black fingernails, fingernails. Robert cuts his nails. Does he have black fingernails? No.

128
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,840
Here Mireille is doing her nails

129
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,380
Those are Mireille's nails

130
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,220
And this is one of Mireille's uncles

131
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,460
A fingernail, an uncle

132
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,740
This gentleman also wears dark glasses

133
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,180
He placed his dark glasses next to a cup of black coffee.

134
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,340
It's not a latte, it's black coffee without milk, an espresso

135
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,500
This gentleman is also strange because he has a tic.

136
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:37,200
He has a nervous tic. He blinks his eyes. That's the verb "to blink".

137
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,940
And these are turn signals.

138
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,660
This tic annoys Mireille. So, she's about to leave, but she spots Robert.

139
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,500
Where is he, Robert? He's across the street, on the other side of the boulevard.

140
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,920
He went to the wrong cafe.

141
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,560
When he notices there's another cafe across the street,

142
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:19,420
When he realizes he's gone to the wrong café, he jumps up very quickly. He springs up. A spring. Springs. He springs up. He leaps. Now, what leaps? A panther leaps. A car with lightning-fast acceleration leaps. There you go, a car leaps.

143
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:27,340
Robert takes a few steps forward, stops, then goes back.

144
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,840
He turns around, he goes back because he forgot to pay

145
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,280
Robert is an honest boy

146
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,560
Look, the car is going backwards

147
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,080
Robert leaves, he stops, and he goes back.

148
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,440
And he throws a banknote on the table

149
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,920
He throws a candy

150
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,380
He throws a stone.

151
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,880
And this lady throws away an old sock.

152
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,380
She throws a bottle of poison in the trash.

153
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,180
He's going to throw the croissant away, you'll see.

154
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,620
Marie-Laure throws away an old cheese.

155
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,380
Marie-Laure throws away an empty packet of biscuits.

156
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,020
Robert throws a banknote onto the table.

157
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,960
Then he runs off again.

158
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,900
Here, he walks.

159
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,320
And here he runs.

160
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,400
He runs.

161
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,360
They run, they run, they run.

162
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,500
Run to Citroën.

163
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,200
They too are running. That's the verb "to run".

164
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,040
Robert sets off down the boulevard.

165
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,220
He runs, he lunges forward.

166
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,620
He leaps forward, he leaps into the void.

167
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,220
He sets off.

168
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,680
A screeching brake is heard.

169
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,820
A sudden stop.

170
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,920
A turn of the wheel

171
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,920
A punch

172
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,160
A kick

173
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,700
A kick

174
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,560
A hammer blow

175
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,860
A knife attack

176
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,740
A Japanese sword strike

177
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,400
A statue blow

178
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,080
A phone call

179
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,680
A ring of the doorbell

180
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,020
A ring of the doorbell

181
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,300
It's Hubert, I recognize his ring of the doorbell.

182
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,080
when Robert sets off down the boulevard without looking to the right or left

183
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,000
a screeching brake is heard

184
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,560
We also hear a resounding curse.

185
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,940
fucking shit

186
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,200
Fuck, get lost, you dirty bastard!

187
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,620
Did Robert get run over?

188
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,740
Is he dead?

189
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,020
No, he is not dead.

190
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,800
we can't kill him right away

191
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,940
We still need him

192
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,660
The study of the subjunctive has only just begun

193
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,660
Robert was not crushed

194
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,080
But he almost got run over.

195
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,540
I'm not late, am I?

196
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,200
No, no, in a way it doesn't start for another two hours.

197
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,260
Do you want to go?

198
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,020
Okay, let's go

199
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,760
Let's go

200
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,040
And off they go, it's our old friend the glass broom

201
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,640
Do you want to go?

202
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,060
Okay, let's go, let's go, they're going

203
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:24,340
Robert and Mireille would like two tickets, two tickets please, cinema tickets

204
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:36,740
Mrs. Bello is seating people on the train; she's showing them their seats. Here, Mireille has taken...

205
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:45,340
Marie-Laure's place, it's a shame we couldn't come on Monday, why? Because

206
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:52,000
It's cheaper on Mondays. The usherette is waiting. She's waiting for a tip. She's waiting for someone to...

207
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,460
She gives him a tip. She expects a tip. She expects someone to give her a tip.

208
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,760
gives a tip. But Robert doesn't give him a tip. He doesn't know that he should

209
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,140
tip the ushers. He doesn't know. And you, Jean-Claude, you are

210
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:18,100
Aware? I don't know. He doesn't know. He's not aware. Sometimes it's

211
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,500
It's dangerous to know. It's better not to know, listen. Why?

212
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,300
Didn't you alert the police? Because those people are too dangerous. You

213
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:33,380
You know I'm aware. They'd kill me too. I didn't know. You should have.

214
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,420
Tell me. Why didn't you tell me? How am I supposed to know? How do you expect me to

215
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,440
As far as I know

216
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,280
Robert doesn't know, he can't know

217
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,480
He is not aware

218
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,780
This is Madame Bello.

219
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,820
Who isn't aware?

220
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,240
She doesn't know, she can't know

221
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,980
You don't know where my Asterix is?

222
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,040
How am I supposed to know?

223
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,780
Know, it's the subjunctive mood.

224
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,800
From the verb to know

225
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,520
How am I supposed to know?

226
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,180
Now, it's your turn.

227
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,400
You're going to talk a little

228
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Listen carefully to the dialogue between Robert and Mireille and then you will play the role of Robert.

229
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Did she expect us to give her a tip?

230
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Oh really, we have to tip the ushers?

231
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Yes, that's the habit.

232
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
I didn't know. I'm not aware of that. How am I supposed to know?

233
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Now, it's your turn. You are Robert.

234
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Did she expect us to give her a tip?

235
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Oh really, we have to tip the ushers?

236
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Oh really, we have to tip the ushers?

237
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,360
Oh really? We have to tip the ushers?

238
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,260
Yes, that's the habit.

239
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,440
I'm not aware of that. I'm not aware of that.

240
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,420
I'm not aware of that.

241
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,400
How am I supposed to know? How am I supposed to know?

242
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,520
How am I supposed to know?

243
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:01,700
After the advertisement, the lights come back on in the theater and the ushers become saleswomen.

244
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,000
The ushers become saleswomen.

245
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,500
She sells candy, popsicles.

246
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,820
Ask in the candy room, ice cream bars.

247
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,920
Here is a newspaper vendor.

248
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,940
A saleswoman in a pastry shop.

249
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,540
A salesperson in a department store.

250
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,200
Finally, the film begins.

251
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,480
Robert is afraid he won't understand.

252
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,720
He's acting a bit like an idiot.

253
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,920
Hey, you'll have to explain it to me if I don't understand.

254
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,080
Promise?

255
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,140
I'll draw you a little picture.

256
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,860
A drawing helps you understand better, that's true.

257
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,820
But suggesting a small drawing is ironic.

258
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,120
Generally, people understand without a small drawing

259
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,960
Listen to Marie-Laure here

260
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
What is it?

261
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,460
Don't you understand? Don't you want me to draw you a little picture?

262
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,460
Come on, get out of here, give me back my seat!

263
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,500
I'll draw you a little picture.

264
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,080
But be quiet now

265
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,260
Shh! Those two aren't going to shut up anytime soon.

266
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,460
Shh! That means be quiet, remember?

267
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,900
It's the verb "to be silent".

268
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,540
Only water-based paint...

269
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,680
You will be quiet.

270
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,020
I will remain silent if I want to.

271
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,520
Water-based paint is more difficult...

272
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,000
But shut up!

273
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,320
Marie-Laure, please be quiet.

274
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,360
Hold on tight.

275
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,860
Well-behaved children should be quiet at the table.

276
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,500
And well-mannered people remain silent in the cinema.

277
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,460
Are there really some ill-mannered people out there?

278
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,880
Robert is ill-mannered because he talks in the cinema.

279
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,240
Hubert is very well-mannered.

280
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,400
But Marie-Laure isn't always very well-mannered.

281
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,680
Marie-Laure.

282
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,920
What ?

283
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,360
Stop.

284
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,960
You're bothering me.

285
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,920
Can you be rude?

286
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,040
Mireille isn't always well-mannered either.

287
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,260
Shit.

288
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,380
How rude of you to be!

289
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,560
For better or worse, Mr. and Mrs. Belleau raised three daughters.

290
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,320
And this gentleman, he raises dogs. He's a dog breeder.

291
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,040
Mr. Moric breeds purebred dogs.

292
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,980
And they, they raise oysters.

293
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,020
Oyster farming is a profession that cannot be improvised.

294
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
We also raise chickens.

295
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,540
The hero of Love in the Afternoon is a young executive.

296
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,160
An executive, a business leader, an office manager,

297
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,940
Someone who leads, who has responsibilities.

298
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,340
They are not managers, they are workers.

299
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,200
Ms. Belleau, who is a department head, is an executive.

300
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,120
They are surely managers.

301
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:46,080
This young gentleman, this dynamic and friendly young executive, meets a somewhat bohemian young woman.

302
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,980
She's a bit bohemian, she's a bit whimsical.

303
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,960
She doesn't lead a very regular life.

304
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,480
This lady is not bohemian at all.

305
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,040
This one looks a bit bohemian, yes.

306
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,580
This one too.

307
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:09,640
So this somewhat bohemian young woman decides to seduce the dynamic young executive.

308
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,600
She gets it into her head, she decides to seduce him.

309
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,360
The friendly young executive, etc., is tempted.

310
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,180
Here, it is Eve who is tempted.

311
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,760
The serpent tempts Eve. It is a scene of temptation.

312
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,520
The young, likeable executive, etc., etc., resists temptation.

313
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,720
He escapes temptation.

314
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,380
He escapes and goes to find his wife.

315
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
It's a very moral story.

316
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,460
Finally, all of this is very moral.

317
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,400
Okay, now it's your turn. Let's see what you have to say.

318
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,300
Look at Mireille on the rotunda terrace.

319
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,180
What is she doing?

320
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,180
She waits. Waits for whom?

321
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,300
Robert, obviously.

322
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,700
Next to Mireille, there is a strange gentleman.

323
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,800
What is he wearing?

324
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,620
He has a black hat and a black tie.

325
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,200
Look, Mr. Courtois is arriving. What does he have under his arm?

326
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,120
It's a raincoat.

327
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,120
What is she trying on? Socks or shoes?

328
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,300
Shoes.

329
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:28,800
He has black whiskers. He also has... black... black fingernails.

330
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,880
Look at Marie-Laure. She's finished the packet of biscuits.

331
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,680
And what does she do with the empty package? She... she throws it away.

332
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,300
What are they doing? Are they walking or running?

333
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,080
They are running.

334
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,300
Look at Marie-Laure. What is she giving to Mireille?

335
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,220
Blows.

336
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:53,080
And Robert, here, he makes a phone call.

337
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,160
And that's a real setback.

338
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,080
Look, is that an usherette or a saleswoman?

339
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,000
She's an usherette.

340
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,060
And this?

341
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,340
That's a saleswoman.

342
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,000
Look at Marie-Laure, here.

343
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,260
Is she well-mannered or badly-mannered?

344
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,840
Poorly behaved.

345
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,700
Is love in the afternoon a moral or immoral affair?

346
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,680
Oh, it's a moral story, a very moral one.

347
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,900
It might be very moralistic, but I didn't understand anything.

348
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,460
It's okay, don't worry, I'll explain.

349
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,800
I'll draw you a little picture.

350
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,300
Hush! Aren't those two going to shut up soon?

351
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,260
Oh dear, are there some badly behaved legs here?

352
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,040
We can no longer sleep peacefully.

353
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

354
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:42,300
...

355
00:27:42,300 --> 00:28:12,280
Subtitles ST' 501

356
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:42,280
Subtitles ST' 501

357
00:28:42,300 --> 00:29:12,280
French subtitles?
