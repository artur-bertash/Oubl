00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:58,560
Good morning ladies, good morning young ladies, good morning gentlemen.

5
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,800
"I am the teacher. We are going to learn French."

6
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,460
Do you agree? Does everyone understand?

7
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,380
Yes, indeed. You are the teacher, we are the students, and we are going to learn French.

8
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,560
Oh, but you speak French. Are you French?

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:16,860
Non.

10
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
But do you know French?

11
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,860
A little bit.

12
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,740
Oh, okay. Well then, listen carefully.

13
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,980
We are going to learn French.

14
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,100
All right ?

15
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,540
And to learn French

16
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,820
We are going to invent a story

17
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,040
A story?

18
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,940
Yes, a story

19
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,760
A story like the story of Babar

20
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,640
Like the story of Asterix

21
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,640
A story like the story of Peter and the Wolf

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,680
A story like the story of the fox and the wolf

23
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,880
A story like the story of Little Red Riding Hood.

24
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,760
We're going to invent a story. Why?

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,740
We are going to invent a story to learn French.

26
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,280
We are going to invent a story because it will be useful for learning French.

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,400
Will this be useful?

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,820
Yes, of course, it will be useful.

29
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,960
To learn French?

30
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:27,560
Yes indeed! Inventing a story will be useful for learning French.

31
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Okay, then it's settled. We're going to invent a story.

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,600
Yes, but who will invent the story? You or us?

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,800
What will invent history? Why, we will! You and I.

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm going to propose the story.

35
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,360
Well, what about us then?

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:04:02,340
Well, you're going to invent the story with me. We're going to invent the story together. You and I together. Okay?

37
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,800
All right.

38
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,300
All right ?

39
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,780
All right.

40
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:14,740
Okay. So, we're going to invent a story. A story.

41
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:21,600
The story of an elephant?

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,060
Non.

43
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,420
The story of a man and a woman?

44
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,840
The story of Ansel and Gretel?

45
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,760
The story of Paul and Virginie?

46
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:31,960
Non.

47
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,400
Listen, this is going to be the story of two young people.

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,880
The story of two young people?

49
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, the story of two young people.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,260
The story of a young man and a young woman, okay?

51
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,400
Why not ?

52
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,260
Okay, very good. It's going to be the story of a young man and a young woman.

53
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,180
What will the young man be? Will the young man be Italian?

54
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,880
Good morning, how are you?

55
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
No, not Italian.

56
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:08,040
No? The young man isn't going to be Italian? What will he be then? Will he be Spanish?

57
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,460
Hi how are things ?

58
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,700
Non.

59
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,500
So, what will it be? Will it be English?

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,700
Why not ?

61
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,600
No, he's not going to be English.

62
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,700
So, what will it be? Will it be Japanese?

63
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,580
Konnichiwa, hajimemashite.

64
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,580
No, he's not going to be Japanese.

65
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,500
So, what will it be? Will it be Norwegian?

66
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,220
Good dog, you big dog.

67
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,940
No, he's not going to be Norwegian.

68
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,880
So, what is it going to be?

69
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,920
American?

70
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,620
If you wish.

71
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,860
Okay, very good.

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,880
The young man is going to be American.

73
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,860
The young man is going to be American.

74
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,480
And what will become of the young girl?

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,360
Is she going to be American?

76
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,640
Non.

77
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,700
Is she going to be Norwegian?

78
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,880
Is she going to be Japanese?

79
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,220
Is she going to be English?

80
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,280
Will she be French?

81
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,680
Yes, that's it. The girl is going to be French.

82
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,920
To learn French, a young French girl will be useful, okay?

83
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,500
The young girl is going to be French.

84
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,820
Why is the girl going to be French?

85
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,100
Because it will be useful for learning French.

86
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,220
To learn French, we are going to invent a story.

87
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,020
It's going to be the story of two young people.

88
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,760
A young man and a young woman.

89
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,960
The girl will be French and the young man will be American.

90
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,520
The two young people are going to make friends.

91
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,040
They are going to have a lot of friends.

92
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,840
We will choose friends for the two young people.

93
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,940
We are going to invent adventures, journeys.

94
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,620
We're going to discuss all of this together, you and I.

95
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,580
It's going to be a game, it's going to be fun.

96
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,880
But let's hope, let's hope it's going to be fun.

97
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,600
Yes, it's going to be fun, of course.

98
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,140
It's going to be fun and useful.

99
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,040
To learn French.

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:38,720
That's it. It's going to be fun and it's going to be useful for learning French.

101
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,900
Ladies, young ladies, gentlemen, listen up.

102
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,060
We are going to learn French.

103
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,660
Ladies.

104
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Ladies.

105
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,760
Ladies.

106
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,020

Sir, ladies, madam, ladies, madam, ladies, madam, miss, miss,

109
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,600
Ladies

Gentlemen

114
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,420

Gentlemen

116

118
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,000
Gentlemen

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,420
Listen

120
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,980
Listen

121
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,860
Look, he's listening

122
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,660
He listens.

123
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,660
He listens.

124
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
Hello, how can I listen?

125
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,400
She listens.

126
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,300
She listens.

127
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,200
She listens.

128
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,800
Listen, Elsa.

129
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,440
Listen carefully, Patricia.

130
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,740
Okay, well, you listen too.

131
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,220
Listen, okay? You're going to listen.

132
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,620
So, I'm calm and I'm listening to you.

133
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,400
Listen.

134
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:29,740
I am the teacher. I am going to speak. Blah blah blah. I am going to speak French. I am going to speak because I am the teacher.

135
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:43,240
And you, you're going to listen because you're the students. The professor is going to speak and the students are going to listen. The students are listening, okay?

136
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,720
Oh no. The students will speak and the professor will listen.

137
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,720
Yes, of course. The students will also speak.

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,300
Okay. But now I'm going to speak and you're going to listen.

139
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,100
Go ahead, listen.

140
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,560
To learn French, we are going to invent a story.

141
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,680
A story like the story of Babar or the story of Winnie the Pooh.

142
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,860
Look at this little girl. What is she going to do?

143
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,360
I'm going to tell you a story. So, you see, this is...

144
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,120
A story. We are going to invent a story.

145
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,320
We're going to invent. It's going to be an invention.

146
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,920
Look at this prehistoric man. He's going to invent the wheel.

147
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,420
The Chinese invented gunpowder.

148
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
Edison invented the electric light bulb.

149
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
What are you going to invent next?

150
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,400
Marie-Laure also invents things.

151
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,660
What are you going to invent next?

152
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,300
Here's a phone, try it.

153
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,200
I see.

154
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,740
In the thread.

155
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,880
Hello ?

156
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,840
We are going to invent a story.

157
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,520
The story of two young people.

158
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,400
It's going to be the story of two young people.

159
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,180
A young girl and a young man.

160
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,380
A young man, a young man, a young girl, a young girl.

161
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,820
What is that? A young man or a young woman?

162
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,660
A young girl, yes. And what is this?

163
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,120
A young girl? No, she's not a young girl, she's a lady.

164
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,480
And that's a lady? No, that's not a lady, that's a priest.

165
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
That's a young girl. And what's that? A young girl?

166
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,420
No, not really, no.

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,180
That's a little girl.

That's a young man.

169

No, not really, he's a little boy.

174
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,760
What is this?

175
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,340
A young girl, yes.

176
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,620
And this?

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,980
Young girls.

179
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,460

If you wish.

241

Look at Marie-Laure, she's going to say why not.

242
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,480
That's enough, you're not going to eat them all.

243
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,500
And why not?

244
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,740
Because you're going to get sick.

245
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,140
Look at this gentleman, you'll see.

246
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,240
He's going to say, "Why not?"

247
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,120
Excuse me, sir, do you want to learn Japanese?

248
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,280
Non.

249

Why not ?

257
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,860
We are going to invent journeys.

258
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:37,580
Train journeys, car journeys, plane journeys, helicopter journeys, there you have it, people going on journeys.

259
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:46,200
We're going to invent trips, adventures, all kinds of adventures.

260
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:58,340
Romantic adventures

261
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,680
Yes, yes, but who's going to invent all this?

262
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,060
You, her, him, her, them, us

263
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,120
You and I, we

264
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,500
Me, you, us

265
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:28,620
We, you, him, them, her, she, we will invent the story together.

266
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,520
I will present the story and you will discuss it.

267
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,380
You are going to have a discussion.

268
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,540
Yes, no, okay, no, no, I don't agree, yes, no.

269
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,420
It's united.

270
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,740
So, there you have it, we're going to talk.

271
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,860
Look, they're talking.

272
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,000
"You seem to be saying it's up to us to do the work. I know what you're thinking, go on. Oh well, say it, I'll tell you."

273
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,920
"Just a small change. A small change, but you got the money?"

274
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:07,600
They discuss. I'm going to propose the story, and you're going to discuss the story with me. We're going to discuss, we're going to invent together.

275
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,320
Look, she and he are together. They are together.

Are you together? Yes. Yes, they are together. Are you together? No. They are not together. They are traveling together.

277

Are you happy that we're traveling together? Yes. We're going to invent the story together. Okay? Do you agree? Look, they agree.

278
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,740
"Okay. Okay, that's settled."

00:18:48,740 --> 00:19:02,460
Do they agree? Oh no, they don't agree. They don't agree. And they, do they agree? Yes, they're together and they agree.

280
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,620
And here? Here, they are together, but they disagree.

281
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,840
We're going to invent the story together. Okay?

282
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,700
It's going to be fun. It's going to be a game. A game.

283
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,380
Belote and Rebelote.

284
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,980
A game like belote, for example. Belote is a card game.

285
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,560
Look at Marie-Laure and Mireille here. They're playing a game.

286
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:38,120
I've got you, you've got me by the chin. The first one to laugh will get a slap.

287
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:47,640
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's playing a game. She's playing hopscotch. Hopscotch is a game.

288
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,480
Look at Mireille and Marie-Laure. They're playing a game. It's a fun game.

289
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,560
The puppet show is fun too.

290
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,940
That's a funny story. It's a Belgian story.

291
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,560
He's funny too.

292
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,380
And is Marie-Laure's game there any fun?

293
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,760
Does that amuse you?

294
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,880
Yes, it's fun.

295
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,600
We are going to invent a story, journeys, adventures.

296
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,020
We'll discuss all of this together.

297
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,740
It's going to be a game.

298
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,760
It's going to be fun.

299
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,040
Let's hope so.

300
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,840
Yes, let's hope it's going to be fun.

301
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,440
He hopes it will be fun.

302
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,360
We must hope.

303
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,620
We must always have hope.

304
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,400
Look, see Marie-Laure here.

305
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,900
I hope they're chocolates.

306
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,460
They're chocolates.

307
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,400
She hopes. She hopes it will be chocolates.

308
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,600
I hope these are chocolates.

309
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,920
Damn! These aren't chocolates.

310
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,040
Mireille hopes so too.

311
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,600
She hopes that Marie-Laure will give her chocolates.

312
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,700
I hope you'll give me some.

313
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,800
I don't know. We'll have to see.

314
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,280
Look here. Aunt Georgette is not well.

315
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,980
Mireille hopes she will get better.

316
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,760
I'm not doing well.

317
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm tired.

318
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,200
I hope things will get better.

319
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,540
Are you going to be able to get up?

320
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,520
Well, I hope so.

321
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,500
We're trying it slowly.

322
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,380
Now you are going to speak French.

323
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,560
Listen to this dialogue between Mireille and her friend Jean-Michel.

324
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,700
You will repeat Jean-Michel's answers.

325
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,960
So, we're going to invent a story.

326
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,960
Shall we invent a story?

327
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,980

Well, you're going to invent the story with me.

We're going to invent adventures, journeys.

331
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,520
This is going to be fun, isn't it?

332
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,640
Let's hope so. Let's hope it's going to be fun.

333
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,600
Now it's your turn. You are Jean-Michel.

We are going to invent a story.

349
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,520
It's going to be fun and it's going to be useful.

350
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,020
This will be useful for learning French.

351
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,860
Funny, ha ha ha ha ha, and useful.

352
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,180
A pencil, a pencil, it's useful for writing.

353
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,740
Glasses, glasses, they're useful for reading.

354
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,120
A key, a key, it's useful for opening things.

355
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,620
A tie, a tie, no, a tie, it's nice, but it's not useful.

356
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:41,100
A handkerchief, yes. A handkerchief, a handkerchief. It's useful. And cigarettes. Cigarettes are useful. Cigarettes, no. Cigarettes aren't useful. Let's see if you've understood. A pencil, yes, it's useful. Cigarettes, no, they aren't useful.

357
00:23:41,100 --> 00:24:00,660
Leeks? Yes, they're useful. Flowers? No, they're not useful. Observe. We're going to learn French. We're going to invent a story. You're going to discuss the story. Observe.

358
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,900
Hello, and where are you going? You see, I'm going to walk Fido.

359
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,800
Now, observe this

360
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,600
Hello, what are you doing?

361
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,120
You see, I'm walking Fido

362
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,300
Compared

363
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,260
You see, I'm going to walk Fido

364
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,100
You see, I'm walking Fido

365
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,900
Now, look at this young man.

366
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,820
He's going to call

367
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,940
He's going to eat

368
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,280
This is the immediate future

369
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,840
Now he eats

370
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,500
This is the present.

371
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,760
Now, look at Marie-Laure eating too much chocolate.

372
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,920
That's enough, you're not going to eat them all.

373
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,940
And why not?

374
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,180
Because you're going to get sick.

375
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,780
She's going to be sick.

376
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,820
This is the immediate future.

377
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,880
Now, look here.

378
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,360
What is it?

379
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,700
I'm sick.

380
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,220
Now she is sick.

381
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,940
This is the present.

382
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,800
Look at Ousmane.

383
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,380
He's going to work.

384
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:31,660
And now, he works. He is going to work, he is going to study; this is the immediate future. Now, he works, he studies; this is the present. He eats; present. He is going to eat; immediate future. He is going to study, he is going to discuss, he is going to speak, he is going to listen; immediate future.

385
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:41,380
Let's see if you've understood. I'm the professor, you're the students.

386
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:48,880
What are we going to do? We are going to learn French, and to learn the

387
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:58,720
French, what are we going to do? We're going to invent a story. Here we go.

388
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:08,680
I invented a story together. I'll suggest the story and you...

389
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:16,820
You're going to discuss the story; it's going to be the story of two young people, one

390
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:28,300
A young man and a young woman, of course, it's going to be fun and useful, useful for

391
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:40,660
Finally learning French, let's hope, let's hope it will be useful and fun, let's hope, let's hope, let's hope
