2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and fly away.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very soon, you will see what happens

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and you will be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
After afternoon drinks,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Everyone says hello, except Mireille and Robert.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They decide, after consulting the training guides,

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
to see the film "Love in the Afternoon"

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the following day, “In the Afternoon”.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
They stop to meet at a cafe near the theatre.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,740
Thursday evening, at the Bélots' house, the meal finally comes to an end.

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,520
What if we went to the living room?

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,960
That's a very good idea.

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,500
Very good, it's delicious.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,480
Do you want mint with a linden tree?

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,100
No, thank you.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,280
And you, will you have your herbal tea?

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,020
Yes, please.

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,340
Perhaps you would like some alcohol, Mr. Taylor?

20
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,320
Yes of course.

21
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,680
I'll see what I have.

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,100
That's a lovely painting. Is it by a family member?

23
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,960
Yes, it's other people.

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,300
I have Grand Marnier and Cognac.

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,960
Colette, and you?

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,740
A small Grand Marnier.

27
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,980
A Grand Marnier.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,460
THANKS.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mireille, would you like something?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, me too, a Grand Marnier.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mr. Taylor, a Grand Marnier, please.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, you have to try it, it's very, very good, you'll see.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hubert, and you?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, I prefer cognac, if you don't mind.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ah, cognac.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's very good, very, very good.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THANKS.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you, thank you.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,180
To your health

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not taking anything

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,800
To your health

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Do you want some alcohol, darling?

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
I raise my glass particularly

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
to the lady of the house

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,100
a cognac

47
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,620
Oh yes

48
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,660
He is very, very good.

49
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,280
hold

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,540
that's quite strong

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,760
It's getting late

52
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,420
Have you seen what time it is, Marie-Laure?

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,640
Yes

54
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,120
Go to bed, right now!

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,860
Say good evening

56
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,180
Good evening

57
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,320
Good evening, Marie-Laure

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,440
Good evening, the question

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Good evening

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,940
Good evening

61
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,740
Good evening

62
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,140
Good evening, my dear

63
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,140
Will you come and say good evening to me?

64
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,580
Yes. Hurry up.

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,240
After kissing her parents goodbye, Marie-Laure went to bed.

66
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,780
Colette left around 11pm to return to Provins.

67
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,320
Oh yes, 11 o'clock.

68
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,120
I have to get out of here, I'm going to miss my train.

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,300
Goodbye, Hubert.

70
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,340
Bye.

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,260
Goodbye, Robert.

72
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,140
Good evening.

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,900
Good evening.

74
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,120
Hi, Colette.

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
Samirai, I'm calling you.

76
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:46,940
OK.

77
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,900
Good day sir.

78
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,640
Bye.

79
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,220
Goodbye, Colette.

80
00:03:52,220 --> 00:04:00,460
Thank you very much, Mr. and Mrs. Bello. I believe they apologized shortly afterwards.

81
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,240
We should probably go to bed, yes, excuse us, we took

82
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,260
the habit of going to bed early

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,600
On Madam, tributes and thank you, sleep well, I hope we didn't

84
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,860
Too tired, they're having a delicious meal. Goodnight, Mom, you'll wake me up tomorrow.

85
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:34,360
Morning before leaving. Yes, darling. Good. Good evening. Good evening, Hubert. Finally, Hubert is taking his leave. It's after 11 p.m. Good evening, because I'm going to leave too.

86
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,360
So, shall we talk on the phone?

87
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Sir...

88
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Robert and Mireille are left alone.

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,420
I suppose it's too late to go to the cinema now.

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,820
No, I'm afraid of it.

91
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,540
But do you want us to go tomorrow morning?

92
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,800
Tomorrow morning?

93
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,020
No, morning, afternoon.

94
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,060
Yeah, if you want.

95
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,680
What are we going to see?

96
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,500
I don't know.

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,980
Do you see a periscope over there?

98
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,220
What is this ?

99
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,560
It's like the official show guide.

100
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,340
Hey, here's one.

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,700
This is a program of shows.

102
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,700
It's theatre, dance, cinema, exhibition, concert, in short, everything.

103
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,720
It shows all the films that are playing in Paris.

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,740
Classified by neighborhood and by genre.

105
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,360
By genre?

106
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,960
Because in France, even films are either masculine or feminine.

107
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,960
Oh, don't be an idiot. I mean, they're classified as adventure films, westerns,

108
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,020
dramatic comedies, psychological dramas, musicals, erotic films, animated films,

109
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,380
And there's even a short summary of each film. Really? What do you see that's interesting? Let's see.

110
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,780
What we're giving away this week. Nagisa Oshima's "The Ceremony," original version. How are we

111
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:26,560
Japanese? A bit rusty. What else? The Red Female Detachment, original version

112
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,620
Chinese, the great Yugoslav silence, be serious, I must be able to

113
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,840
to understand, but there are always subtitles

114
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:45,460
Here's an American slice, you think you'd understand? Oh, but that's not right, it's

115
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,740
Forbidden to those under 18, that's enough, that's enough anyway.

116
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,280
It's the one from last week, so what, so what, it's no longer good.

117
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:09,600
Programs change every week, let's check on the unit.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,680
"Spends the afternoon on July 14th" by Nas, that's a beautiful title.

119
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,940
It must be very informative, but you know, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

120
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,900
One of Eric Romere's six moral tales, it doesn't matter, it must be very

121
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:33,520
Interesting, let's see. Do you want to go? Yes, okay, then let's meet at

122
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,140
1:30 pm on the rotunda terrace, it's right next door

123
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,420
You just have to take the metro and get off at Vavin, it's right across the street.

124
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:50,100
You can't go wrong, of course, so see you tomorrow, at... how do you say it?

125
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,400
La Rotonde, boulevard Montparnasse, metro 20-20.

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,100
Okay, at La Rotonde, at 1:30 pm.

127
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,600
I will have to understand you.

128
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,400
Okay, good evening.

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,100
The timer button is there, on the right. Do you see?

130
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
Where?

131
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,600
There, the little light.

132
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
To be ?

133
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
You have two minutes to get down.

134
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Two minutes? Why?

135
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Do I need to get down in two minutes?

136
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
What is this all about?

137
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Yes, when you press the button,

138
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
The light stays on for two minutes, and then it goes off.

139
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,100
We're used to the way the economy works in France. You need to understand that.

140
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Those French are crazy.

141
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,100
No, we're not crazy. We're saving energy.

142
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Okay, hurry up, it's going to go out.

143
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
It will turn off.

144
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Good evening.

145
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
It's after dinner.

146
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
After dinner,

147
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:25,380
There are people who drink coffee and sometimes alcohol such as cognac, armagnac, pear, raspberry or liqueurs.

148
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,800
Mr. and Mrs. Bello do not drink alcohol or liquor.

149
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,800
They also don't drink coffee or tea, because the caffeine keeps them awake.

150
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,640
They drink an infusion, a herbal tea, linden for example or verbena.

151
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,940
It's good in the evening, at bedtime, because it helps you sleep.

152
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,380
It's getting late. It's starting to get late.

153
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,520
It's getting late.

154
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,720
Madame Belleau sends Marie-Laure to bed. She sends her to bed.

155
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,340
Have you seen what time it is, Marie-Laure?

156
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,080
Yes.

157
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,680
Okay, off to bed.

158
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,540
Right away.

159
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,480
Robert is lying down here. He is in bed.

160
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,260
Here, Mireille is lying down, she is in bed

161
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,540
She is sick

162
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,160
Here, Marie-Laure is lying down, she is in bed

163
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,100
Mr. and Mrs. Bello are also going to bed

164
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,620
I think we should go to bed

165
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,320
Yes, excuse us, we've gotten into the habit of going to bed early.

166
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,900
Ah, I'm exhausted.

167
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,280
I'm going to bed

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,320
Okay, well, everyone's going to bed now.

169
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
Okay, everyone to bed

170
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,980
Good evening, everyone

171
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,900
Good evening

172
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Goodnight, my dear, sleep well

173
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,940
Good evening madam, my respects and thank you, sleep well

174
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,300
Will you come and say good evening to me?

175
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,840
Yes, hurry up

176
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,820
Good evening

177
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,460
Mom, will you wake me up tomorrow morning before you leave?

178
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,740
You're going to sleep there

179
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,800
You will be very well

180
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,680
Good night

181
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,840
Mireille wants her mother to wake her up

182
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,760
Look at Jean-Claude here, he's falling asleep

183
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,660
And look at great-uncle Casimir, he's falling asleep.

184
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,580
Look at Marie-Laure, she's asleep.

185
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,780
Look at Robert, he's waking up.

186
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,660
A cup of coffee, madam.

187
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,440
Oh yes, I'd love that, it'll wake me up.

188
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,280
Now look at the little boy, he's going to wake up his dad.

189
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,620
Wake up, you're going to be late.

190
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,300
And here, it's the mother who gets woken up.

191
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,800
Mom, this is for you, Cécile. She said you needed to wake up.

192
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,300
Yes, hello, Cécile, what's going on?

193
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,300
Oh, but what time is it?

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,100
Ten past twelve, miss.

195
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,060
Please come back in one hour.

196
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,760
The belots have gotten into the habit of going to bed early.

197
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Yes, excuse us, we've gotten into the habit of going to bed early.

198
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,880
They've gotten used to it.

199
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
He goes to bed early every night.

200
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Mireille has gotten into the habit of buying her newspaper at Mrs. Rosa's.

201
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Every morning, she buys her newspaper from Mrs. Rosa. It's a habit.

202
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,300
And you remember, Marie-Laure, she has a bad habit.

203
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
She should break that habit.

204
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Oh, stop! Are you going to break that habit?

205
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,300
And you, are you going to stop bothering me?

206
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Colette leaves around 11 p.m.

207
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,040
Oh dear, 11 a.m. I have to get out of here.

208
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,000
She ran away. Do you remember, Jean-Pierre?

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,540
I'm running away.

210
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,020
I'm running away.

211
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,020
And Mireille?

212
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,200
Excuse me, I'm off.

213
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,800
She also said, I'm off.

214
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,260
Oh dear, excuse me, I'm off. I'm going to be late. Goodbye.

215
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,120
Colette is leaving to return to Provins.

216
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,860
She returns to Provins.

217
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,380
Excuse me, miss.

218
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,240
You remember that Robert met Mireille in the courtyard of the Sorbonne.

219
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,800
The next day, he returned to the Sorbonne.

220
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,240
He went back there.

221
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,500
Hubert takes his leave.

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,720
He's leaving.

223
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,700
I'm going to leave too.

224
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,880
Yes, I'm going to take some time off.

225
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,180
So, shall we talk on the phone?

226
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,300
Shall we talk on the phone?

227
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Are you calling me?

228
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,280
Shall I call you?

229
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,580
Hello, is that you Guylaine?

230
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,340
Mireille calls Guylaine.

231
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,680
She calls him.

232
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,720
Hello, is that you Guylaine?

233
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,800
She calls Guylaine.

234
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,960
She calls him.

235
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,580
She calls him, she phones him.

236
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,940
Robert is not happy because it is late.

237
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,880
It's too late to go to the cinema.

238
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,340
I suppose it's too late to go to the cinema now.

239
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,760
No, I'm afraid of it.

240
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,280
But do you want us to go tomorrow morning?

241
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Do you want to go to the cinema tomorrow?

242
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,080
Does Mireille say they are going to the cinema?

243
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,320
No, she doesn't say let's go.

244
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,200
She said, "Do you want to go?"

245
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:19,540
She's suggesting a possibility. She's talking about the possibility of going to the movies. She's not saying they're going. Do you want to go to the movies? "Aille" is a form of the verb "aller" (to go). It's the subjunctive mood of the verb "aller".

246
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:32,300
We already know the imperative mood, which gives an order: let's go to the cinema. We know the indicative mood, which indicates a fact, a real action: we are going to the cinema.

247
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,460
And now we have the subjunctive mood, which speaks of an action without indicating that it is real.

248
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:48,660
Do you want to go to the cinema? "Do you want to go to the cinema" does not indicate that they are going, have gone, or will go.

249
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,660
If you want us to go to the cinema, just talk about the possibility of going to the cinema.

250
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,300
Robert and Mireille want to go to the cinema.

251
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,420
Okay, very well, but where are they going to go?

252
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,540
What are they going to see?

253
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,900
What are we going to see?

254
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,680
I don't know.

255
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,160
It depends on what we're playing at the moment.

256
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,520
Hey, what are we showing at the film club tonight?

257
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,980
It depends on what we go through.

258
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,680
There are several ways to know what is happening.

259
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,700
The most modern way to get the programs is via Minitel.

260
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,340
And then there are the specialist publications, such as Paris Scope, the official entertainment guide, etc.

261
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,720
If you want to go to the cinema, what do you consult to find out the programs?

262
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,680
The newspapers. I read the newspapers.

263
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,680
Which newspapers?

264
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,660
Entertainment journals.

265
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,480
For example ?

266
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,120
Paris Scope.

267
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,440
The Paris Scope.

268
00:15:40,440 --> 00:16:01,620
It includes all the shows, the theatre, all the plays currently being performed in Paris, the music, all the concerts of the week, the dance, the exhibitions,

269
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,980
Cinema, all the films showing in Paris this week

270
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,660
The films are classified by genre

271
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,220
Adventure, western, etc.

272
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
By genre?

273
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,760
Because in France, even films are either masculine or feminine.

274
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,880
Oh, but don't be an idiot.

275
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,960
Don't act like an idiot, don't be stupid

276
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,640
Here, it's Mireille who's acting silly.

277
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,540
And Marie-Laure doesn't like that

278
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Hey, my gumballs!

279
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,620
What gumballs? There are no gumballs here.

280
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,620
Come on, don't be an idiot. Give me my gumballs.

281
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,620
Are there gumballs here? Impossible.

282
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Come on, be serious.

283
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Do you remember Marie-Laure who played the airplane?

284
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,620
And Mr. Bello was the bricklayer.

285
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,620
Mr. Bello is not really a bricklayer, but he acts like one.

286
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,860
Robert isn't really stupid, but he acts like an idiot.

287
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,200
Oh, but he's not being silly. I mean, they're categorized by adventure film.

288
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:19,420
There are all sorts of genres. Westerns, dramedies, psychological dramas, musicals, erotic films, cartoons.

289
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,540
What do you see that's interesting?

290
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,240
What do you see that's interesting? What is interesting about it?

291
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:50,240
"Do you see anything interesting? Do you see anything good? I'd like something fun. Something good, something fun. Something interesting, nothing interesting. Do you remember Hubert's uncles who run the construction company? They don't do anything interesting."

292
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,220
"They don't do anything particularly fascinating."

293
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,160
What else? There's nothing good.

294
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,180
What do you see that's interesting?

295
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,120
Mireille suggests a Japanese film.

296
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,200
What does it mean to be Japanese?

297
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,320
A little rusty.

298
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,280
Robert's Japanese is a bit rusty.

299
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,700
Not very good, not very functional.

300
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,320
Rust.

301
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,040
A rusty gate.

302
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,660
A rusty pump.

303
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,260
A rusty suit of armor.

304
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,440
Rusty, in poor condition.

305
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,040
Note that if Robert's Japanese is rusty,

306
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,460
It's not a problem, because there are always subtitles for films in their original version.

307
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,140
Mireille offers other foreign films in their original version.

308
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,360
Detachment, Red Feminine, original Chinese version.

309
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,100
The Great Silence, Yugoslavia.

310
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,160
Listen, be serious, I need to be able to understand.

311
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,820
Be serious.

312
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,020
Mireille is not serious.

313
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,480
She's having fun, she's joking around.

314
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,400
She offers her films in foreign languages ​​as a joke, for laughs. It's not serious.

315
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,820
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's serious. But here, she's acting silly. She's not serious.

316
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,500
Look at Marie-Laure here. She hurt her fingers. But it's not serious. It's nothing to worry about.

317
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,120
Now, look at Marie-Laure here. She says she's in pain all over.

318
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,360
But Mireille thinks it's not serious. Mireille doesn't take it seriously.

319
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,340
Oh, my neck hurts, my fingers hurt, my legs hurt.

320
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,960
Oh dear, this looks very serious.

321
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,020
Marie-Laure does a little English at school, but it's not very serious.

322
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,940
I'm doing English, but it's not serious.

323
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,420
On apprend, why do you do, I'm very well, thank you, c'est tout.

324
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,160
And here, do you remember? Mireille is having fun, she's not serious.

325
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,400
Come on, don't be silly, give me my gumballs.

326
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,100
Are there gumballs here? Impossible.

327
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,220
Come on, be serious.

328
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,900
But I'm serious, I didn't see any gumballs.

329
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,860
Be serious, I need to be able to understand.

330
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,340
Be serious.

331
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,300
So, that's the imperative of the verb "to be".

332
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,780
You remember, Hubert? Be sure, my dear sir.

333
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,740
Rest assured that I fully share your opinion, sir.

334
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,020
Be serious, I need to be able to understand.

335
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,100
Observe.

336
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:28,600
"I can't understand. I can't understand Chinese or Japanese. That's a fact. That's the existing reality. Robert can't understand."

337
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:39,940
I need to be able to understand, I need to be able to understand, "can," that's the subjunctive.

338
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:48,080
Mireille suggests another film, but it is forbidden for people under 18 years of age.

339
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,960
Oh no, that's not right, it's forbidden for those under 18.

340
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,060
It's forbidden, no entry, you can't pass.

341
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:59,880
No entry, you cannot enter this street from this direction.

342
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,140
Parking is prohibited.

343
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,340
No entry to the lawn.

344
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,260
Display prohibited, it cannot be displayed.

345
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,440
Smoking is prohibited in this room.

346
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,160
Everything is forbidden.

347
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,540
We're showing an old Eric Romère film called Love in the Afternoon.

348
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,380
Robert likes the title.

349
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,740
That's a great title.

350
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,600
It must be very informative, it must be informative, we must be able to

351
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,640
learn a lot with this, the great universal dictionary, the redhead

352
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,500
For example, it's an informative book; you can learn a lot from it.

353
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,640
Robert might be disappointed; he might find the film less interesting than

354
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,940
Look at what he's imagining, this gentleman, he's going to be disappointed

355
00:21:47,940 --> 00:22:02,400
You see, he's very disappointed, he's disappointed too. Oh, you know, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed too.

356
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,880
One of Eric Romere's six moral tales, that doesn't matter, it must be very interesting, let's go

357
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,940
Seeing that doesn't matter, oh well, it's not a big deal, it doesn't matter, just observe

358
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,720
I saw what time it is. It's too late to go to the cinema.

359
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,380
It doesn't matter, we'll go tomorrow.

360
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,760
A chicken, Mireille, please.

361
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm sorry, madam, there are none left.

362
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,940
It doesn't matter. I'll have the duck breast.

363
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,200
Listen carefully to the conversation between Robert and Mireille about love in the afternoon.

364
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,140
Next, you will play the role of Robert.

365
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,360
Hey, we're spending the afternoon on love on July 14th by Nass.

366
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Oh, that's a great title. It must be very informative.

367
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,260
Oh, you know, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. It's one of Eric Romere's six moral tales.

368
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,320
It doesn't matter. It must be very interesting. Let's go see it.

369
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,160
Now, it's your turn. You are Robert.

370
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,200
Hey, we're spending the afternoon on love on July 14th by Nass.

371
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,780
Oh, that's a great title. It must be very informative.

372
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,860
Oh, that's a great title. It must be very informative.

373
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:17,040
Oh, that's a nice title.

374
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,280
That must be very informative.

375
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,100
Oh, you know, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

376
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
This is one of Eric Romere's six moral tales.

377
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,520
It doesn't matter.

378
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,300
That must be very interesting.

379
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,540
Let's go see that.

380
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,000
It doesn't matter.

381
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,760
That must be very interesting.

382
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,020
Let's go see that.

383
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,940
It doesn't matter.

384
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,980
That must be very interesting. Let's go see it.

385
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,720
Okay, do you want to go?

386
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:43,920
Yes.

387
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,160
Okay. Then see you at 1:30 pm on the terrace of the Rotonde.

388
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,020
It's right next door.

389
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,740
The cinema is right next to the Rotonde. It's very close.

390
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,620
As Robert goes downstairs, the light automatically switches off.

391
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,580
It's the timer, a mechanism to save electricity.

392
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,560
In France, we like to save money.

393
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,520
No, he doesn't like saving money, he spends.

394
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,640
But Marie-Laure is saving money

395
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,800
She saves her money

396
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,720
Now let's see what you can say

397
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,440
Listen, watch, think, and speak

398
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,340
If you sleep poorly, what is best to take before going to bed?

399
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,720
Tea, coffee, or herbal tea?

400
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,340
An infusion?

401
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,240
Yes, an infusion

402
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,640
Yes, Marie-Laure

403
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,860
In bed

404
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,360
In bed, that's it.

405
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,520
Your daughter is going to bed, what do you tell her?

406
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,100
You tell him

407
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,800
Goodnight my dear, sleep well

408
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,960
Mrs. Belleau is going to bed, what do you say to her?

409
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,460
You say

410
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,940
Sleep well

411
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,340
It's getting late, you're leaving, what do you say?

412
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,800
You say

413
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,420
I have to escape

414
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,340
You're leaving, you want to talk to Mireille tomorrow, what do you say?

415
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,880
You say, then, this phone Mireille wants to speak to Guylaine who is in

416
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:23,340
England, what is she doing? She's calling him, she's calling her.

417
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,980
He calls him, that's it. Robert is very disappointed because he is

418
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,580
Too late to go to the cinema tonight, what do you suggest?

419
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:40,160
You tell him, "Do you want to go tomorrow? We're showing a foreign film in its original version."

420
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:50,240
What do you need to know to understand subtitles, and why is there a need for subtitles?

421
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:59,380
You can't smoke in this room, it's forbidden, it's forbidden, according to you, Grand

422
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,380
Is my Larousse dictionary a fun or educational book?

423
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
Quite informative.

424
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,380
You're tired, the conversation bores you, you've had enough, what do you say?

425
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Look, Mr. Guignol.

426
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,380
Have you seen what time it is?

427
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,380
Well, I think I should go to bed.

428
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,380
Excuse me, but I've gotten into the habit of going to bed early.

429
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,020
I need to go get my bed.

430
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,160
Okay, there you go.

431
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,620
Okay, good evening.

432
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,880
Good night.

433
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,460
Sleep well.

434
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,740
What is this?

435
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,380
Mr. Guignol who sleeps in my dining room?

436
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,380
But this Mr. Guignol is crazy.

437
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,180
I'm not crazy.

438
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,300
I'm saving energy.

439
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:27,380
...

440
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:56,380
