Watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,020
Pretty soon you will figure out what's going on

4
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,300
and be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,620
Our two characters must have names.

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,800
She will be Mireille and he, Robert.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,920
She gets working parents and two sisters, one married.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,460
Robert is an only child.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,920
His mother is French.

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,160
His parents are divorced, his mother remarried.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,200
Robert just may have a few hang-ups.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,420
Good morning, ladies, good morning, young ladies, good morning, gentlemen.

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,880
Let's continue inventing history.

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,080
Well, first of all, we need to give the young people a first name.

15
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,120
Well, why?

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,520
Why? It's elementary, my dear Watson.

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,200
We need to give young people a first name because everyone has a first name.

18
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,840
I have a first name. My first name is Pierre.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,420
You have a first name. What is your first name?

20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,980
Michael.

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,920
Well, you see, he has a first name.

22
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,360
You too have a first name. What is your first name?

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,780
Julia.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,960
You see, she too has a first name.

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,900
Everyone has a first name

26
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,260
Me, her, him

27
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,240
Everyone has a first name

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,920
But the young people in the story don't have first names.

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,040
This isn't going to work, it's not possible.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,540
Young people need to be given a first name.

31
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,680
Because it's not easy to tell a story without a first name

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,100
So, let's give the young people a first name.

33
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's see, first of all, what's the girl's name going to be?

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,440
Invented

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,260
Oh no, it's a pretty name, but it won't work, it's an American name

36
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,120
The girl is French, she needs a French first name

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,400
Listen, the girl's name is going to be Mireille.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,260
Why?

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,080
Because it's a pretty name, isn't it Mireille?

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,380
It's pretty. It's a pretty name.

41
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,680
And besides, it's not easy to pronounce.

42
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,840
Here, try it. Say Mireille.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,000
Say Mireille. Go on, go ahead.

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,040
Mireille.

45
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
Listen, Mireille.

46
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,360
Go ahead, try it.

47
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,480
Mireille.

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,460
You see, it's not easy to pronounce.

49
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,700
It's a pretty name, but it's not easy to pronounce.

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,520
The young man's first name will be Robert.

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,260
No, no, no, no discussion.

52
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,880
It's decided, the young man's first name will be Robert.

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,460
For what ?

54
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,480
First, because it's a first name that is both French and American.

55
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,140
It's a French first name and it's also an American first name.

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,240
It's a first name that is both French and American.

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,320
And besides, it's not easy to pronounce either.

58
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,920
Robert, it's not easy to pronounce.

59
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,820
Okay, now the two young people in the story have first names.

60
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,000
The girl's first name is...

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,360
Invented.

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,340
It's not Air Force, it's Mireille.

63
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,980
Oh really? Mireille, if you like.

64
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,300
And what is the young man's first name?

65
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,860
Robert ?

66
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,620
No, Robert.

67
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,840
Lobat.

68
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,180
No, Robert.

69
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,500
Robert.

70
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,980
Okay, now we need to give the young people a family.

71
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,900
First, giving the young girl a family.

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:38,800
Let's see.

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,980
Will Mireille's family be poor?

74
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:44,880
Non.

75
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,660
So, will Mireille's family be rich?

76
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,000
Non.

77
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,420
Well, Mireille's family isn't poor, but they aren't rich either.

78
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,060
They are not a poor family, nor are they a rich family.

79
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,340
They are a wealthy family.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Let's see now.

81
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,700
Will Mireille have a mother?

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,480
Yes.

83
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,860
Is she going to have a father?

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,700
Yes.

85
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,320
Okay, so that's settled then.

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,800
Mireille's family is neither poor nor rich.

87
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,880
They are a wealthy family.

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,460
Mireille has a father and a mother.

89
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,860
Mireille's father and mother both work.

90
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,040
They both work.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,840
Mireille's father works at Renaud's.

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
He is an engineer at Renaud.

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,460
And his mother is a department head at the Ministry of Health.

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,680
Mireille has two sisters.

95
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,400
Cécile is older. She is 23 years old.

96
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,580
She is married. Marie-Laure is younger, much younger.

97
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,040
She's ten years old. Is she married, Marie-Laure?

98
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,540
Non.

99
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,320
Obviously. She's too young to be married.

100
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,480
Let's see, how many children do Mireille's father and mother have?

101
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,640
Three. They have three children. Three girls or three boys?

102
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,680
Three girls.

103
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,800
Okay, now let's give Robert a family. Let's see.

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,460
Will Robert have a mother?

105
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:27,760
Yes.

106
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,740
Is he going to have a father?

107
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,240
Yes.

108
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,320
Okay, so Robert has a mother and a father.

109
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,020
Robert's parents have money.

110
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,700
They are even quite rich.

111
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,580
Robert has no sister.

112
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,860
And he doesn't have a brother either.

113
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,600
He is an only child.

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,680
Robert's parents are divorced.

115
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,780
His father has not remarried.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,980
Her mother has remarried.

117
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,520
Poor Robert.

118
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,740
Only child, divorced parents, remarried mother.

119
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,380
He might develop insecurities.

120
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,320
Ah, very good. I love it.

121
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's talk about Robert's complexes.

122
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,500
Are you talking about Robert's complexes?

123
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,900
Oh yes.

124
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,300
For what ?

125
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,160
Because it's going to be fun and useful for learning French.

126
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,160
Do you believe that? Maybe, maybe, but not today.

127
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,280
We don't have time. Another time.

128
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,520
Today, we continue to invent history.

129
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
We continue.

130
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,700
Look.

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,660
Here, I begin.

132
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,400
I continue, I continue, I continue, I continue, I continue and I stop.

133
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,040
Start, continue, stop.

134
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,660
Now, look at Marie-Laure. She's told to stop, but she keeps going.

135
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,660
Stop!

136
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,120
If you continue, it's going to end badly.

137
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:29,660
Mom, listen, if you keep going it's going to end badly. She keeps going and it ends badly for her too.

138
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:42,980
He continued, he told her to stop, but she kept going. "I'll come with you," he said. "Here, no, keep going." Okay, let's continue.

139
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,100
First, we will give the young people a first name.

140
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,000
First, to begin with, look at Marie-Laure.

141
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,980
Marie-Laure, are you going to work?

142
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,600
Yes, but first, I want to watch TV.

143
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,860
You'll work first, you'll watch TV afterwards.

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,880
Understood ?

145
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,280
She wants to watch TV first and work afterwards.

146
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,560
But his mother disagrees. He should work first, watch TV later.

147
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,180
You'll work first, you'll watch TV afterwards.

148
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,640
First, we need to give the young people a first name. Give it. Look.

149
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,480
Here, this is for you.

150
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,560
Uncle Guillaume gives chocolates to Marie-Laure.

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,560
Marie-Laure gives Mireille a candy.

152
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,280
The children give grapes to their father.

153
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,540
They give the little boy a pair of scissors.

154
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,960
They slap the little boy.

155
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,800
Give the dough, give the dough to Mireille.

156
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,500
Come on.

157
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,600
It's very small but it walks well.

158
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,640
They give the girl a lighter.

159
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,420
They give the keys to the man.

160
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,640
Young people need to be given first names.

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
Juliette is a first name

162
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Victor is a first name

163
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
Jean-Paul, that's the first name

164
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,740
Sartre, that's the name, the family name

165
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,980
Simone is the first name

166
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,320
De Beauvoir is the name, the family name

167
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,960
Beatrice is the first name

168
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Laverne is the name, the family name

169
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Corinne is a first name

170
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,900
Everyone has a first name, you'll see.

171
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,980
What is your first name?

172
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,700
Jocelyne.

173
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,480
What is your first name?

174
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,000
Patrice.

175
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,680
Agnes.

176
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,480
Vincent.

177
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,720
Olivier.

178
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,100
We need to give young people a first name because everyone has a first name.

179
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,500
And besides, a first name is useful.

180
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,900
It's useful for telling a story.

181
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,000
So, we need to give the young people a first name.

182
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,820
It's necessary.

183
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,300
It's necessary, it's mandatory.

184
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,400
Look at Marie-Laure, who is sick.

185
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,800
It's necessary !

186
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,820
Now you need to rest.

187
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,660
How are you ?

188
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,340
No, that's not going to work.

189
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,700
For what ?

190
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,840
We need glasses, you see.

191
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Oh!

192
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:33,280
What more do we need?

193
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Well, you need towels.

194
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,400
Excuse me, I have to run, I'm going to be late

195
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,160
I have to go now, I'm late

196
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,800
We need to separate

197
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,840
you should never point the finger

198
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,600
Marie-Laure, you don't work

199
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,140
go to work

200
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,960
we need to work

201
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,340
Young people need to be given a first name.

202
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,680
We must work, we must study, we must listen, we must continue, we must

203
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:14,080
We must try, we must learn, we must understand, we must see, we must be able, we must leave, we must choose, we must give young people a name.

204
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:23,040
We need to give the young people in the story a first name because without a first name, it's not easy to tell a story.

205
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,680
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's telling Fido a story.

206
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,400
He tells a story

207
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,140
He tells a story

208
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,940
Your mother's grandfather and grandmother lived in this house.

209
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,100
He tells a story

210
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,740
Tell me a story

211
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,640
It's not easy to tell a story without a first name

212
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,560
Here is a young man with no first name

213
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,740
And here is a young man with a first name.

214
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,040
Here is a lady and a gentleman with children.

215
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,520
And here is a lady and a gentleman without children.

216
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,160
A lady and a gentleman with children.

217
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,720
A man and a woman with no children.

218
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,180
A man and a woman with children.

219
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,960
A man and a woman with no children.

220
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
Jam with bread.

221
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:32,100
Jam without bread? You're not going to eat your jam without bread.

222
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,920
Why not? Where are you going to the cinema? You're not going to the cinema without me.

223
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:46,360
Why not? It's not going to work, why can't we eat without a fork? Meh.

224
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,400
Why not that then? Look at Aunt Georgette without

225
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:07,020
Fido. Oh really? And Aunt Georgette? Where's Fido? My goodness, Fido! Fido! Marie-Laure with her boat and

226
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:14,880
Marie-Laure without her boat and the boat without Marie-Laure. Let's see if you've got it, okay?

227
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:24,400
being a game lady with children the same lady without children with children without children with

228
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:43,800
100 to you now with 100 with his with his first you have to give the girl a first name

229
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,620
Ah yes, Ethel.

230
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,560
No, Ethel, that's not right.

231
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,420
That won't work because it's not a French first name.

232
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,460
It must be a French first name.

233
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,460
Mireille, yes, it's fine.

234
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,860
But Ethel, no, that won't do.

235
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,760
Eight thirty.

236
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,620
Oh, that's fine, I have time.

237
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,800
Look at Mireille here.

238
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,860
That's not going well.

239
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,960
How are you.

240
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,960
It's going very, very well.

241
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,420
It's okay, it's not okay.

242
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,080
How are you ?

243
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,800
No, that's not going to work.

244
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,160
For what ?

245
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,340
We need glasses, you see.

246
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,160
How are you ?

247
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,300
No, that's not going to work.

248
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,060
The knife on the right and the fork on the left.

249
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,960
Does everyone know that?

250
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,360
The girl's name will be Mireille, okay?

251
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,560
It's a pretty name, isn't it?

252
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,120
Mireille, that's pretty.

253
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,620
And that's a pretty scarf.

254
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,540
What do you think?

255
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,220
Yes, it's pretty.

256
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,840
A nice roast.

257
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,740
He's pretty.

258
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,820
A pretty young girl.

259
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,820
You are so pretty.

260
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,720
Pretty flowers.

261
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,860
It's pretty.

262
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,420
It's pretty, isn't it?

263
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,640
It's very pretty.

264
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,380
It's pretty, all these colors.

265
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,500
Yeah.

266
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,100
It's beautiful.

267
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,560
It's beautiful, isn't it?

268
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,280
Come here, pretty dog. You're a very pretty dog, you know. You're a pretty little dog.

269
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,920
That's a pretty dog. But that one, no, that's not a pretty dog.

270
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,060
She is pretty. She is not pretty.

271
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,460
Now you are going to speak French.

272
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,680
Listen to this dialogue between Mireille and her friend Jean-Michel.

273
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,820
You will repeat Jean-Michel's answers.

274
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:49,040
"It's going to be the story of two young people. A young man and a young woman. And the young woman's name is going to be..."

275
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,380
"Mireille. The girl's name will be Mireille."

276
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,660
"Why is that?"

277
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,960
"Because it's a pretty name."

278
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,820
Now it's your turn, you are Jean-Michel.

279
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,060
"And the girl's first name will be..."

280
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:08,460
"Mireille. The girl's name will be Mireille. Mireille. The girl's name will be Mireille."

281
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:16,280
Mireille. The girl's name will be Mireille.

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,420
Why is that?

283
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,640
Because it's a pretty name.

284
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,440
Because it's a pretty name.

285
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,640
Because it's a pretty name.

286
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,140
The young man's first name will be Robert.

287
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,440
It's a pretty name, and it's not an easy name to pronounce.

288
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,460
Robert. Here, pronounce it.

289
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,740
Robert. Say Robert.

290
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,040
Robert.

291
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,500
Robert.

292
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,020
Robert.

293
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:56,060
Robert. R, R, R. Listen. Robert. Robert. Look. Robert. R, R, R.

294
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,100
Robert is a nice name. Not easy to pronounce.

295
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:08,100
And besides, it's a French first name. And it's also an American first name.

296
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,540
It's a first name that is both French and American.

297
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,640
It's both French and American.

298
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,260
Look, look at this centaur.

299
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,640
He is both a man and a horse.

300
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,820
And a mermaid is both a woman and a fish.

301
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,380
Listen to what Mireille is going to say.

302
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,660
But be careful, you can't wear everything at once.

303
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,820
Plates first, glasses second.

304
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,020
You're not going to eat two chocolates at once, are you?

305
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,220
And why not?

306
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,380
Now, we need to give these young people a family.

307
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,080
A family. That's a family. That's a family.

308
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
No, that's not a family.

309
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,060
Now that's a family.

310
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,560
And this is a family?

311
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,200
No, it's not a family.

312
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,060
And this?

313
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,560
Now that's a family.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,200
Mireille's family is not rich.

315
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,500
She's not poor either.

316
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,120
She is well-off.

317
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,860
Is she rich?

318
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,340
No, she is not rich.

319
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,580
Is she poor?

320
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,700
No, she's not poor either.

321
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,600
She is well-off. They are a well-off family.

322
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,780
Rich, poor, rich, poor.

323
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,400
He, on the other hand, is rather poor.

324
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,880
Now, look at this man.

325
