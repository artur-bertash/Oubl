Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,980
Subtitling by Radio-Canada

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,640
Robert and Mireille went to see L'Amour l'après-midi at the 14 juillet Parnasse.

4
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,900
They are leaving the cinema.

5
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,660
How about we go for a walk?

6
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,900
Oh yes, I'd love that. I love getting my teeth caught in that area.

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,840
Let's head over to Montparnasse.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,520
You need to get to know the neighborhoods of artists and intellectuals.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,700
I thought it was Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

10
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,700
Yes, it was first Montmartre, then Montparnasse, Saint-Germain.

11
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Hey, Modigliani lived here.

12
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,700
You see, all of this is a painter's studio.

13
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,940
Suddenly, in front of a bookstore, Robert stops, looking worried.

14
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,480
He searches in his pockets.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
What is it?

16
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,020
My passport.

17
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,600
What, you lost it?

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,400
I don't know, I don't have it.

19
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,860
Are you sure you had it? You didn't leave it in your room, did you?

20
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,460
You think so? I thought I had taken it.

21
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,840
But listen, go and see. I'm waiting for you here. Hurry up.

22
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:38,300
He'll be back soon with his seersucker jacket and his passport.

23
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,920
SO ?

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,220
I have it.

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,600
It was in my jacket.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,880
Well, you see, everything's fine.

27
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,100
All's well that ends well, as my Aunt Georgette says.

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,960
Here we go ?

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,560
And they resume their stroll through Montparnasse.

31
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,280
And here are the literary cafes.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,920
At the beginning of the century, one could meet Trotsky, Lenin, Fujita, Picasso there.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,600
So, what did you think of the film? Did you like it?

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,460
Yes, of course. But if I had to choose, I think I prefer My Night at Maud's.

35
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,960
Yes, what an idea! Well, I never!

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,760
My night at Maud's is a bit too chaste. Nothing happens, there's no action.

37
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,640
These are just discussions about religion, Marxism, Pascal's wager.

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,180
I suppose there are people to call.

39
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,340
That's interesting, Romain, but it's not cinema.

40
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,600
Why? Because for you, cinema is about violence and eroticism?

41
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,940
What is strutting about?

42
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,140
No, not at all. I never said that.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,820
But I wonder if true cinema wasn't silent film.

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,180
Do you see Charlie Chaplin's films?

45
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,180
Charlie Chaplin? Which Charlie Chaplin? De Gaulle?

46
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,540
But don't be an idiot.

47
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,200
Haven't you ever heard of the emigrant, the street and towards gold?

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,340
That's cinema. There's no need for a soundtrack.

49
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,520
Look at Griffiths, Lerus, Eisenstein, Pudovkin.

50
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,420
It's all in the pictures.

51
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,520
The editing, the interplay of close-ups and wide shots.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,920
Oh really? So you're against talking pictures.

53
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,560
Against colour as well, I suppose.

54
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,380
Not necessarily, but there are some wonderful black and white films.

55
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,840
While talking, they walked past Rodin's statue.

56
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,520
who represents Balzac.

57
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,100
One day, when Marie-Laure was little,

58
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,480
She passed by there with her mother.

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,440
And she said, "Mom, look at the cow."

60
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,920
Then they walked past the garage

61
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,000
where Robert rented a car to go to Provins.

62
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,600
Oh, that's where I rented a car the other day.

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,980
when I went for a walk in Burgundy.

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,900
Ah good ?

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,220
Yes yes.

66
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,580
Then, they followed Boulevard Saint-Germain

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,140
up to the National Assembly.

68
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,980
This is where the MP prepares draft bills.

69
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,420
Then he sends them across the street to the Senate.

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,380
They crossed the Seine, on the Concorde bridge,

71
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,140
where they stopped for a moment.

72
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,060
To the right, over there, is the Musée d'Orsay.

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,940
It used to be a train station.

74
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,120
And now it's a 19th-century museum.

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,080
And in the distance, over there, you can see the Île de la Cité.

76
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,120
On the left, the Louvre and the Tuileries Garden.

77
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,140
And over there, opposite, in the background, is the Madeleine church.

78
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,360
That's where my mother wants me to get married, because of the staircase.

79
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,460
And on the left, the white house behind the trees, that's the American embassy.

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,680
That's where you'll need to go the next time you lose your passport.

81
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,220
You haven't lost it yet, you still have it.

82
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,260
Okay, I've got it.

83
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,820
In the middle of the square, that's the obelisk, I imagine.

84
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,340
Let's take a closer look.

85
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,180
I would like to try to decipher some hieroglyphs.

86
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,640
Oh no, you're crazy.

87
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,560
You saw the traffic, we're going to get crushed.

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,900
Let's head towards the Champs-Elysées instead.

89
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:27,900
In the walkways behind the small palace, there is calm and silence.

90
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,700
A few sparrows are bathing in the dust.

91
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,080
Two soldiers, on leave, arrive from the opposite direction.

92
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,840
Robert's heart-shaped jacket seems to amuse them.

93
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,420
Hey, did you see the butcher boy prostituting his girlfriend?

94
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,040
Mireille turns around and, without a word, in three precise gestures,

95
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,300
She sees it rolling in the dust, much to Robert's surprise.

96
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,800
What's gotten into you? Don't you think you're going a bit too far?

97
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,320
I don't like it when people make fun of others.

98
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,200
And then I needed to do some exercise, I missed my karate lesson on Saturday.

99
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,980
I'm starting to get a little confused.

100
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm a little thirsty, hey, shall we go get something to drink?

101
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,700
If you want.

102
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,440
And Robert, disgusted, throws his jacket away like a circus-circus-circus-man.

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?

104
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,500
She picks up the jacket.

105
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,840
Those Americans are crazy.

106
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,840
In France, we have a sense of economy.

107
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:28,680
and they will sit down

108
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,100
on the terrace of Fouquet

109
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:48,920
after all this exercise

110
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,820
Mireille is thirsty

111
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,860
So she suggests going for a drink.

112
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,640
Shall we go and have a drink?

113
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,060
If we were going to have a drink, that's a suggestion.

114
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,800
As they leave the cinema, Robert suggests he take a short walk.

115
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,140
How about we go for a walk?

116
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,200
If we walked, that's a suggestion

117
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,060
Hey, how about we go to the movies, huh?

118
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,740
What if we went to dinner on a riverboat?

119
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,980
What if we flew away?

120
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,680
What if we bought something?

121
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,040
How about we go for a walk?

122
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,220
Oh yes, I'd love that. I love running around Paris.

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,240
Let's head over to Montparnasse.

124
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,920
You need to get to know the neighborhoods of artists and intellectuals.

125
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,300
Around 1920, there were many intellectuals and artists in Montparnasse.

126
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,000
Lenin, Trotsky, Picasso, Fugita, and Modigliani were all there.

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,280
There are still many painters' studios in Montparnasse.

128
00:08:45,280 --> 00:09:01,380
Here is a painter's workshop, a weaving workshop, an industrial design workshop, a welding workshop, an assembly workshop, a cabinetmaking workshop.

129
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,080
Mireille wants to talk about the film they just saw.

130
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,480
So what did you think of the film? Did you like it?

131
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
You liked it, that's the past tense of the verb "plaire" (to please). Do you remember?

132
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Lacan! What an idea!

133
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,280
And do you like it?

134
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Do you like it? Yes.

135
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,280
But if I had to choose, I think I prefer the other one.

136
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Did you like it? Yes, of course.

137
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,280
But if I had to choose, I think I prefer My Night at Maud's.

138
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,280
This is another film by Eric Romere. It's a serious film.

139
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Mireille thinks it's too chaste.

140
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:58,220
Nothing's happening. There are only discussions about serious topics. Marxism, religion, Pascal's wager. Pascal, a 17th-century thinker. He said that we can't know if God exists.

141
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:07,200
So you have to bet, you have to place a bet, look, we can't know where the

142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:16,980
This heart, you have to bet, I bet it's there, but I don't really know, I'm betting, it's a bet.

143
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,700
You're a nurse, this bet

144
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:26,820
We know it's interesting, mind you, but it's not cinema.

145
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,480
Why? Because for you, cinema is about violence and eroticism?

146
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,240
Violence

147
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,200
Eroticism

148
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,140
No not at all

149
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,320
I would be very happy to see you

150
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,640
But I wonder if true cinema wasn't silent film.

151
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,060
Today, films have sound.

152
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,460
So I'm calm and I'm listening to you

153
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,060
The characters are speaking

154
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,060
In the past, films didn't talk. They were silent.

155
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,060
This little boy doesn't speak either.

156
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,060
Besides, he's mute. Next time, try to find me one who speaks.

157
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
She too is mute.

158
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
So, you tell me everything.

159
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Non ?

160
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Is it really that serious?

161
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
Very serious?

162
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,060
Very, very serious?

163
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,060
Finally, you'll tell me, won't you?

164
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,060
Charlie Chaplin's films were silent.

165
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,240
Charlot is Charlie Chaplin. General de Gaulle was also called Charles, but he wasn't called that.

166
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Charlie Chaplin, there were some very good silent films, films without a soundtrack, that expressed themselves very well.

167
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,940
well thanks to the editing of the images, the interplay of general shots, wide shots and close-ups

168
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:51,780
Shots, a wide shot, a close-up, that's cinema, that's cinema, Mireille thinks so.

169
00:11:51,780 --> 00:12:02,580
Well, she admires that, that's an ice cream, that's a car, there was no need for stripes

170
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,640
Sound? Oh really? So you're against talking pictures? You remember, you can be for them.

171
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:15,900
or against Marie Laure, for example, and for cinema is against homework then

172
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:25,200
Go to the cinema, I'm not against it, I'm against homework. Now

173
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,660
You are going to speak for a little while, listen to this exchange between Mireille and Robert, then you will answer.

174
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,000
To Mireille, as if you were Robert, what did you think of the film? Did you like it?

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,040
Yes, of course, but if I had to choose, I think I'd prefer my night at Maude's. Oh yes, what an idea!

176
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,640
Well, not me. My night at home is a bit too chaste. Nothing happens, there's no action.

177
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,020
That's interesting, mind you, but it's not cinema.

178
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,380
Why? Because for you, cinema is about violence? Eroticism?

179
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:06,300
No, not at all, I never said that. But I wonder if true cinema wasn't silent film.

180
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,660
Oh really? So you're against talking pictures. And against color too, I suppose.

181
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,660
Now it's your turn. You are Robert. Answer Mireille.

182
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,160
So, what did you think of the film? Did you like it?

183
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,620
Yes, of course. But if I had to choose, I think I prefer My Night at Maud's.

184
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,300
Yes, of course. But if I had to choose, I think I prefer My Night at Maud's.

185
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,880
Yes, of course. But if I had to choose, I think I prefer My Night at Maud's.

186
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,840
Oh really? What an idea.

187
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,280
Well, not me.

188
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,580
My night at Maud's is a little too chaste.

189
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,360
Nothing happens, there is no action.

190
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,760
That's interesting, mind you, but it's not cinema.

191
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,960
For what ?

192
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,800
Because for you, cinema is about violence?

193
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,920
Eroticism?

194
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,260
For what ?

195
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,180
Because for you, cinema is about violence?

196
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,960
Eroticism?

197
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,400
For what ?

198
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,600
Because for you, cinema is about violence and eroticism?

199
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
No, not at all, I never said that.

200
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,460
But I wonder if true cinema wasn't silent film.

201
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,940
Oh really? So you're against talking pictures.

202
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,820
And against colour as well, I suppose.

203
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,100
Oh really? So you're against talking pictures.

204
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,000
And against colour as well, I suppose.

205
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,000
"Oh really? So you're against talking pictures. And against color too, I suppose."

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,960
While talking, Robert and Mireille passed by the statue of Balzac.

207
00:14:52,420 --> 00:15:02,100
Balzac, you know, a 19th century novelist, the author of The Human Comedy, Father Goriot, The Priest of Tours, Cousin Bette.

208
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,800
When Marie-Laure was little, she didn't know it was Balzac. She thought it was a cow.

209
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:20,220
Walking down Boulevard Saint-Germain, Robert and Mireille arrived in front of the National Assembly.

210
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,280
This is where members of parliament meet to prepare bills.

211
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,580
Then they send them to the Senate, across the street from Mireille's house.

212
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,280
They send them.

213
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,640
Look, here they are passing the ball to each other.

214
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,020
They pass the ball to each other.

215
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,380
He throws the ball right in his face

216
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,300
And Marie-Laure sends her ball into Uncle Guillaume's glass

217
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,860
He sends a candy

218
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,220
He sends the suitcase

219
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,160
And Marie-Laure sends a kiss

220
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,280
She sends a letter

221
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,220
And the members of parliament send the bills to the Senate

222
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
It's the verb "to send".

223
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:16,780
Robert and Mireille stopped on the Concorde bridge to admire the view.

224
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,520
On the right, the Musée d'Orsay. It used to be a train station. Now it's a museum, a 19th-century museum.

225
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,420
In the background, you can see the Île de la Cité, with Notre-Dame and Sainte-Chapelle.

226
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,420
On the left, you can see the Louvre with the Tuileries Garden.

227
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,320
And further to the left, you can see the Place de la Concorde.

228
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,840
And at the end of the royal street, the Madeleine church.

229
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,520
That's where my mother wants me to get married, because of the staircase.

230
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,020
There's a very beautiful staircase. It's perfect for large weddings.

231
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,300
Madame Belleau wants Mireille to get married at the Madeleine church because of the staircase.

232
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,580
Because there's this staircase.

233
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,720
It's not easy coming here. It's because of the dogs, we're forced to live apart from them.

234
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,940
Thanks anyway.

235
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,160
There's no need to thank me. If I was running the asylum, it was only because of my sister.

236
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:16,120
Mr. Bello likes their apartment because of the view. Because there is a lovely view.

237
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,740
We really like this apartment because of the view. A breathtaking view of the Luxembourg Gardens.

238
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:29,340
The view is breathtaking because of the Luxembourg Gardens. Because the Luxembourg Gardens are right in front of it.

239
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,480
Mireille does something stupid because of Marie-Laure.

240
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
But look what I've done because of you!

241
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Because of me! Oh, that's a good one!

242
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
It's my fault! Oh my!

243
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,480
That's where my mother wants me to get married, because of the staircase.

244
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,480
And on the left, the white house behind the trees, that's the American embassy.

245
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,480
That's where you'll need to go the next time you lose your passport.

246
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,940
When you lose your passport, Robert hasn't lost his.

247
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,140
Okay, I've got it.

248
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,880
But he's sure to lose it again.

249
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,460
So, when he loses it, he'll have to go to the American embassy.

250
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,480
Can I go watch TV?

251
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,700
When you've finished watching, not before.

252
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,220
I'll never finish.

253
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:35,320
Robert wants to take a closer look at the obelisk to try and decipher the hieroglyphs.

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,420
I would like to try to decipher some hieroglyphs.

255
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,520
He taught himself to read. He might even be able to decipher hieroglyphs.

256
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,720
It was Champollion who first deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs.

257
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,740
What is in the middle of the Place de la Concorde?

258
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,340
The obelisk.

259
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,460
Who comes from where?

260
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:03,740
I don't know, you know what's on it, probably something written or engraved.

261
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:11,600
You don't know what they are? No, they're hieroglyphs that Robert wants to decipher, but Mireille

262
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,420
She disagrees because of the traffic on the Place de la Concorde; she's afraid of...

263
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:28,100
We're going to get run over. We're going to get run over. Watch out! We're going to run you over! Do you remember?

264
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:37,820
Robert has already almost been run over. If he crosses the Place de la Concorde, he

265
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:45,240
will get run over again because there's a lot of traffic. But in the aisles,

266
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,960
It's calmer down at the bottom of the Champs-Élysées.

267
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:57,360
The Avenue des Champs-Élysées, an avenue, a street, a path, a path, a path,

268
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,860
An alley, an alley, an alley, an alley, an alley.

269
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,520
The paths behind the small palace are quiet.

270
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,580
There are sparrows bathing in the dust.

271
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,740
They are swimming in the sea.

272
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:27,560
And she, she bathes in a swimming pool. He, he bathes in his bathtub. And the sparrows bathe in the dust. The dust. A cloud of dust.

273
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:37,620
Two soldiers on leave arrive. They are not on duty. They are on leave. He is on duty. He too is on duty.

274
00:20:37,620 --> 00:21:03,060
They too are on duty. They too. But these soldiers aren't on duty. They're on leave. The soldiers are making fun of Robert because of his jacket. They think he looks like a butcher. A waiter, a baker's boy, a butcher.

275
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:17,940
She said, "Did you see the butcher boy walking his girl around?" A girl, a young girl, a girl, Mireille.

276
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,320
doesn't like it and she sends the soldier rolling in the dust, she sends him rolling in the

277
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:33,120
dust. She sends it rolling. She sends it rolling on the ground. Here, she sends Marie-Laure

278
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:41,560
Go get the photo album. Go get my album. Here, she sends him to get the snack. So go

279
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:49,200
fetch the snack. Oh, can you be a nuisance? And Madame Belleau sends her off to do her

280
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Marie-Laure, go do your homework.

281
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Go on, disappear.

282
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
And here, she sends them to bed.

283
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Go to bed, go to sleep.

284
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
No discussion, off to bed.

285
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Good evening.

286
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,200
When Mireille sends the soldier rolling in the dust,

287
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
The sparrows fly away.

288
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:30,840
It flies away. The ducks fly away. The plane takes off. It flies away. It takes off. It flies away. The balloons fly away.

289
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,180
The lions flew away. They fly away. Prices are skyrocketing.

290
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,920
What's gotten into you? Robert is a little surprised. He doesn't approve.

291
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,680
Give me back my gumballs! Do you hear? Give me back my gumballs!

292
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,460
Hey, what's wrong with you, are you okay?

293
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,220
Marie, Marie, what possessed you to come and sleep on that?

294
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,680
What ?

295
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,680
Weren't you comfortable in bed?

296
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,720
Mireille needed to do some exercise, because she missed her karate lesson.

297
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,800
And then I needed to do some exercise, I missed my karate lesson on Saturday.

298
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,180
She missed it, she didn't go.

299
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,740
Marie-Laure missed school today because she has a cold.

300
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,200
Today she missed school because she has a sore throat.

301
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,920
Mireille was starting to get rusty because she missed her karate lesson.

302
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,080
I'm starting to get a little rusty.

303
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,360
If you don't exercise, you get rusty.

304
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,240
This gate is rusty.

305
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,420
You remember that Robert's Japanese is a bit rusty.

306
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,740
Your Japanese?

307
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,100
A little rusty.

308
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,320
That too is rusting, rusting, rusting

309
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,040
Mireille suggests going for a drink because she's thirsty after all that exercise.

310
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,840
I'm a little thirsty, you know, shall we go get something to drink?

311
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,020
If you want

312
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,400
Hey, I'm thirsty, what can I get to drink?

313
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I don't know what you want

314
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,760
A little tape

315
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,460
He too is thirsty

316
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,800
They too are thirsty.

317
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,800
If he wakes up, it's because he'll be thirsty, will you hear?

318
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,580
And he's hungry

319
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,140
Yeah, it's 4:30.

320
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
Why does he keep repeating that it's 4:30?

321
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,720
He says that because he's hungry and we haven't had a taste yet.

322
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,660
What if we bought something? Good idea!

323
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,480
He is hungry too.

324
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,760
I didn't eat.

325
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,520
To be hungry, to be thirsty.

326
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,360
Now listen, watch, think, and speak.

327
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,360
If you feel like going for a drink, what do you say?

328
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,340
I'm a little thirsty, hey, shall we go get something to drink?

329
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,180
And if you feel like going for a walk?

330
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,220
How about we go for a walk?

331
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,760
What is it? A workshop or an office?

332
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,920
A workshop.

333
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,240
If you eat an ice cream that is very, very, very, very good, what can you say?

334
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,860
Hmm, that's an ice cream.

335
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:15,260
And if you don't like homework, what do you say? Me, I

336
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:22,160
I'm against homework, what is Marie-Laure doing?

337
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:31,740
Send a kiss, is that a street or an alley? An alley, what's he doing?

338
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:40,600
He bathes where he works, he bathes, the sparrows bathe in a bathtub or in

339
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:50,740
Dust in dust, and that's a waiter or a butcher's boy, a boy

340
00:25:50,740 --> 00:26:00,840
Boucher, is it a talking film or a silent film? Silent if you want to talk about a film you just...

341
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,900
So, what can you say? What did you think of the film?

342
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:17,760
I liked it again, so what did you think of the film? Did you enjoy it, sir?

343
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,040
Guignol, how do you find our story? Do you like it? No, Miss Mireille, it's...

344
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,640
It's a bit too chaste; there's no action, nothing happens. It needs a little more.

345
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,640
A little bit of eroticism, a little bit of violence.

346
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
But what's gotten into you, Mr. Guignol?

347
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Hey, you're going a bit too far there, Mr. Guignol.

348
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
Whoa! Stop!

349
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,640
I am against violence in cinema.

350
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:29,620
French subtitles?

351
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:59,620
