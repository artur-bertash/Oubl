2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You have to look and fly away.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you will be able to say a few words in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is night, and Mireille has let Robert return home for lunch.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After several unnecessary waits, Robert finally managed to send a phone call to Madame Courtois.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She's a big talker, and Robert isn't allowed to enter Edgewise.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But he has a lunch invitation.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,740
It is noon in Paris.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,320
Noon, who said that?

11
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,900
Where is the little mouse?

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,660
What does she do with the lace at the chapel?

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
For whom? For the ladies of Paris.

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,380
Marie-Laure, is that you? Go wash your hands.

15
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,000
Hurry up, you're late.

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,680
It is 12:05 PM. Robert is alone on the terrace of the Closerie des Lilas.

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,740
Mireille has left. She went home to have lunch with Dad, Mom and her little sister.

18
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,060
It is 6:05 AM in New York and 6:05 PM in Mumbai.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,940
Robert set his watch to French time. He just finished his third kir.

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,140
He calls the boy.

21
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,920
Can I make a phone call?

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,500
Yes sir, in the basement, next to the toilets.

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
No, it's not for the toilet. It's for making a phone call.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,500
Yes, sir. The phone booths are downstairs, in the basement.

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,840
Next to the toilets, at the back of the room on the right. Thank you.

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,940
Robert gets up.

27
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,880
He enters the room.

28
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,720
He goes down to the basement to make a phone call.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,620
He is followed by a strange character dressed all in black.

30
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:05,780
Robert enters the booth. He tries to put a coin in the slot of the machine, without success.

31
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:19,300
He leaves the booth, goes back up into the room, and goes to the cashier.

32
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:45,880
Robert goes back down to the basement, enters the cabin, and this time it works again.

33
00:03:49,300 --> 00:04:01,880
Hello, Mrs. Courtois?

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,180
No, the lady is not here.

35
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,520
The lady has gone out.

36
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,800
She went to take Minouche.

37
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,300
She didn't come back.

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,480
She'll be back in a little while for lunch.

39
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,680
Call back around noon, half past noon.

40
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,820
Ah good ?

41
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,340
Thank you, thank you very much.

42
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,840
I won't be able to see in half an hour.

43
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,340
Goodbye, madam.

44
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,620
Oh, madame,

45
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,620
What is she going to say to the lady?

46
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:46,580
Robert goes back into the room.

47
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,120
Always followed by the strange man in black

48
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,520
Robert returns to his table

49
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,300
How much is it?

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,480
30 and 30, 60 and 15, 75

51
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,460
75 francs

52
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,380
Is the service included?

53
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,840
Yes sir, 15%

54
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:33,720
Robert walks along Boulevard Montparnasse.

55
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
He is looking for a phone booth.

56
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,960
Ah, here's one.

57
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,200
But he doesn't seem to understand how it works.

58
00:05:52,200 --> 00:06:08,560
Come on, Robert, a ticket?

59
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,180
Well, definitely not.

60
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,260
You need a card, a magnetic card.

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,040
Try the other one, it works with coins.

62
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,560
Do you have any change?

63
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,340
That's all I have.

64
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Oh no, that won't do.

65
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Is this for Paris?

66
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,020
Yes.

67
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,320
You need 50 centime, 1 franc or 5 franc coins.

68
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
You don't have any change?

69
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,200
No way.

70
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,760
Wait, let me see if I have any.

71
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,620
Here.

72
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,500
Thank you, goodbye.

73
00:06:51,560 --> 00:07:21,540
MFP subtitles.

74
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,660
My dear little one. What a coincidence, we were just talking about you yesterday with my

75
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,120
Husband. How long have you been here? Since yesterday, no, I arrived the day before yesterday.

76
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,140
And how are you? Did you have a good trip? Not too tiring, no?

77
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,740
With the jet lag? My husband, who travels a lot, says that's the hardest part, the jet lag.

78
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,100
Schedule. I don't travel, I stay home. What do you want with Minou?

79
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,360
I can't travel. So your mother didn't come, she didn't accompany you.

80
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,860
Is she still in Argentina?

81
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,000
Salette gave us great pleasure.

82
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,980
Ah, we are looking forward to seeing you.

83
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,840
And I'm sure Minouche will be delighted to meet you.

84
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,440
Minouche is my cat.

85
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,440
She's a bit like our daughter, you know.

86
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,900
So, when are you coming to see us?

87
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,600
Unfortunately, that's not possible today.

88
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,420
Minouche is not doing very well.

89
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,900
No, I don't know what's wrong with her.

90
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,100
And I need to take him to the doctor this afternoon.

91
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,720
And besides, my husband is away. He's traveling.

92
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,120
He's never home, always traveling

93
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,380
Business, you know what that is?

94
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,660
I repeat it to him every day

95
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,820
You should be careful, you're tiring yourself out too much.

96
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,420
This is going to end badly, you're going to give me a heart attack.

97
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,240
He's not listening to me, he's laughing

98
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,380
Ah, men, they're all the same.

99
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,680
So when? Let's see when.

100
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,900
The day after tomorrow?

101
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,060
That's it, just come and have dinner with it the day after tomorrow, that's all.

102
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,860
We will be so happy to see you

103
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,420
So, is that settled?

104
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,700
The day after tomorrow, say 7:30 am, is that okay with you?

105
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:58,900
Do you have the address? It's next to the Nikko, the Japanese hotel. You'll find it. So we'll be waiting for you. Goodbye. And the day after tomorrow. Don't forget, especially.

106
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:10,720
It is 12:45. Robert is hungry. He spots a cafe-restaurant and sits down at an empty table.

107
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:18,040
The waitress serves a young man next to her.

108
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,860
And there you have it, a country ham and a glass of Beaujolais.

109
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,900
There you go. And good sir, what will it be?

110
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,120
Um... a country ham and a glass of Beaujolais, please.

111
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,080
Very good, Robert.

112
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:55,380
Then Robert continued his walk

113
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,040
It is 1:30 AM

114
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,780
Robert returns to the Luxembourg Gardens

115
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:14,240
So, where is that English homework?

116
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,700
Well, I don't have any English homework.

117
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,400
I am in primary school.

118
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,900
I don't do English.

119
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,640
Well, not really.

120
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,680
I'm doing English, but it's not serious.

121
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm learning...

122
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,680
But then, why did I come here?

123
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,780
Mystery and bubblegum.

124
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,780
Would you like one?

125
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,780
Was the garden nice? What did you drink?

126
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,780
I drink Orangina.

127
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,780
You know, young people don't drink alcohol anymore.

128
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,780
Did you see that gentleman over there?

129
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,020
Well, how strange.

130
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,260
Do you know him?

131
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,400
No, but earlier, at the farmhouse, I went to make a phone call and he came down behind me.

132
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,900
He went into the next booth and stayed there while I was on the phone.

133
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,900
He left when I left and he got in behind me.

134
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,280
That's really weird.

135
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,360
Strange, strange.

136
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,460
Initially, Marie-Laure played in Luxembourg.

137
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,360
It is noon.

138
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,380
She sings a nursery rhyme.

139
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,960
Noon, noon, who said that?

140
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,500
Where is the pizzeria?

141
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,400
It's a nursery rhyme. Look, this too, that's a nursery rhyme.

142
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,100
Am, gram, tram, piqué, piqué, collé, gram.

143
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,940
Burré, bourré, rattam, astram, dam.

144
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,060
Astram, gram, piqué, piqué, collé, gram.

145
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,840
Drunk, drunk, ratatam, astram, gram.

146
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,100
You start.

147
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,580
Noon, who said that?

148
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,760
Where is the pizzeria?

149
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,400
What does she do with the lace at the chapel?

150
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,000
For whom? For the ladies of Paris.

151
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,100
Noon, it's lunchtime.

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,840
The Bélots have lunch at noon.

153
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Robert is having lunch in a cafe.

154
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,180
At noon, it's lunchtime.

155
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,020
And in the morning, it's breakfast time.

156
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,180
Here, Robert is having breakfast at the hotel.

157
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,560
Marie-Laure has her breakfast around 7:30 in the morning.

158
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,520
And in the evening, it's dinner time.

159
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,220
The children eat dinner around 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening.

160
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,220
Even the courteous ones, they dine around 8 pm.

161
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,360
It is 12:05 PM.

162
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,540
Marie-Laure goes home for lunch.

163
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,040
She is late.

164
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,420
Hurry up, you're late.

165
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,780
Manuel, we're going to be late.

166
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,200
We're leaving in 5 minutes, quick.

167
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,540
Now go on, because you're going to be late for school.

168
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,340
Ah, you're late, aren't you?

169
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,120
We said two o'clock and it's two quarter past two.

170
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,360
She's hurrying because she's going to be late.

171
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,800
This lady is hurrying.

172
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,060
People are hurrying.

173
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
It's the verb "se dépêcher" (to hurry).

174
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,240
Okay then, are you going to hurry up?

175
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
I'm in a hurry.

176
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,780
Oh, there we go, there we go, I'm coming.

177
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,260
Hurry up.

178
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,420
Go wash your hands.

179
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,920
Hurry up, you're late.

180
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Meanwhile, Robert set his watch to French time, because it was still on New York time.

181
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,920
There is a time difference between Paris and New York.

182
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Do you know how many hours apart there are between Paris and New York?

183
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Six hours less or more?

184
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
In New York, it is six hours earlier than in Paris.

185
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,920
This jet lag, when you travel, is very hard, it's tiring.

186
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,620
The scenes, the arguments too, it's hard, it's unpleasant.

187
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,700
Another scene last night.

188
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,560
Were you harsh?

189
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,120
When you travel, the hardest part is the jet lag.

190
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,860
My husband, who travels a lot, says that the hardest thing is the jet lag.

191
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Robert set his watch to French time and he wants to telephone the courteous one.

192
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,100
Can I make a phone call?

193
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,920
If you want to make a phone call, you can make it from home, of course.

194
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,700
You can make a phone call from a phone booth.

195
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,660
You can make a phone call from a cafe.

196
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,260
In cafes, the telephone is almost always next to the toilets.

197
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,420
And the toilets are still at the end of the corridor.

198
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,060
The toilets are at the end of the corridor.

199
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,840
In cafes, the toilets and telephone are almost always in the basement, downstairs.

200
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,740
Down, up.

201
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,780
The phone is downstairs, in the basement.

202
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,100
Okay, now you're going to talk a little bit.

203
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,560
You will play the role of the boy

204
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,040
Listen

205
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,860
Can I make a phone call?

206
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,320
Yes sir, the phone booths are downstairs in the basement next to the toilets

207
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,860
Now you are going to try to answer Robert

208
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,060
Can I make a phone call?

209
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,520
Yes sir, the phone booths are downstairs in the basement next to the toilets

210
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,560
Yes sir, the phone booths are downstairs in the basement next to the toilets

211
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:24,680
Yes sir, the phone booths are downstairs, in the basement, next to the toilets.

212
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,600
There, you see Robert going down to the basement to make a phone call, since he's in a café.

213
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,400
You can also make a phone call from a public phone booth, in the subway, or on the street.

214
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,840
There are booths that operate with coins.

215
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,740
Ah, not banknotes, no, no, no, we need coins.

216
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,800
That's money, coins.

217
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,460
You should always carry some cash with you.

218
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,080
Look, Robert wants to buy a croque-monsieur.

219
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
but he only has a large 500 franc note.

220
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,340
He has no change.

221
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,160
A croque-monsieur, please.

222
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,160
It's not a big deal, it's not a big deal.

223
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,160
There you go, 9 francs.

224
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,380
9 francs, there you go, a croque-monsieur.

225
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,460
Oh dear, you don't have any change?

226
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,560
No, I don't have any money at all.

227
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,660
Patrick, hey, do you have any change?

228
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,160
Yes, definitely.

229
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,060
This lady is giving change for 20 francs.

230
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,460
If it's 4.10, it's 10.20.

231
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,640
Oh, here we go, it's starting.

232
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,180
Cash.

233
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,040
As if I had nothing better to do, giving everyone their change.

234
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,280
Observe Robert, who wants to pay, how much does it cost?

235
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:57,940
30 and 30, 60 and 15, 75, 75, service is included, yes sir, 15% in general in cafes and

236
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,080
In restaurants, service is included in the bill; at the end of the bill, you add...

237
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:09,560
15% for the waiter's service charge; in hotels, service is generally included.

238
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:15,320
included in the room price. How much is the room? 250 francs. Breakfast is

239
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,840
Included? Yes, service and breakfast included. Robert gives the waiters a 100-franc note.

240
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:28,120
And the boy gives him his change. 15 francs, a 10-franc coin and a 5-franc coin. Okay,

241
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,940
Let's get back to phone booths. Some work with coins, and others...

242
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,620
Others that work with a magnetic card also allow you to make phone calls from an office.

243
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:46,560
A post office (post, telegraph, telephone) in France is the PTT administration which

244
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,920
He takes care of the phone; if you want to talk to someone, you can call them on the phone.

245
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:02,040
Who can call their father? Robert wants to speak to Madame Courtois, so he calls her.

246
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,540
When Robert calls Mrs. Courtois, it's the maid who answers.

247
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,100
Ms. Courtois is not here, she has left.

248
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,760
If the person you are calling is not there,

249
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,860
Well, it needs to be remembered.

250
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,920
Call back around noon, half past noon.

251
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,160
If you can't hear well, it's best to hang up and call back.

252
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,420
Hello? Hello? I can't hear you very well.

253
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,420
Listen, I'm hanging up and I'll call you back.

254
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,920
Robert calls back.

255
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,860
Wait, I'll put it on for you.

256
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,600
Don't hang up, I'll put it through to you.

257
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,720
Wait, don't hang up, the doorbell's ringing.

258
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,360
No, no, I'm not leaving.

259
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,020
They're going to put me through to the service.

260
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,440
Hello, yes?

261
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,740
Mireille ?

262
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,640
Ah, don't hang up.

263
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,060
I'll pass it on to you.

264
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,620
Please come by, Mom.

265
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,940
Can you put my little brother on the phone, please?

266
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,300
The good pass, Mrs. Courtois, to Robert.

267
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,220
Ms. Courtois exclaims.

268
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,860
Ah, Robert! How are you, my dear little one?

269
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,840
What a coincidence! My husband and I were just talking about you yesterday.

270
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,200
Mrs. Courtois and her husband were talking about Robert.

271
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,860
Observe. What is this book about?

272
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,120
What are you reading?

273
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,760
A book.

274
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,560
What is this about?

275
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,320
Well, it's about an elephant.

276
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,020
Ha ha ha! What a coincidence! My husband and I were just talking about you yesterday.

277
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,940
Coincidence, coincidence, she makes me laugh with her coincidence.

278
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,620
It's no coincidence that he was talking about Robert.

279
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,600
This is not a coincidence at all, since he has just received a letter from Robert's mother.

280
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,560
Is she still in Argentina?

281
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,620
You remember that Robert's mother lives in Argentina.

282
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,680
Yes, you were very pleased with his letter.

283
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,540
What else brings pleasure?

284
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,100
The gifts.

285
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,220
Look at Marie-Laure here.

286
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,900
She has just received a beautiful gift, a beautiful boat.

287
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,260
That pleases him.

288
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,920
What still gives him pleasure?

289
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,940
Ah, chocolates.

290
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,500
It's the expression "to please".

291
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,560
Listen.

292
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,160
That's kind.

293
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,460
Dad told me that.

294
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,460
That makes me happy.

295
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:35,580
Robert's arrival pleases Madame Courtois and her husband; they hope to see

296
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:42,780
Robert, soon they are eager to see him, they are impatient, here is an impatient man

297
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,880
Look, Marie-Laure here, she's impatient! Ah, we're impatient to...

298
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,420
I'm sure Minouche will be delighted to meet you.

299
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:02,220
This is our cat Minouche, she will be delighted to meet Robert.

300
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:12,400
She will be very happy, I am delighted to see you. Look at Mireille here, she is delighted.

301
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,700
Madame Courtois' cat doesn't know Robert; she'll be delighted to meet him. Look!

302
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,140
Mrs. Bello here too, she is delighted to meet Robert.

303
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,320
I am delighted to meet you, Ms. Courtois, and I am eager to...

304
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,540
I know Robert, but not today because Minouche is sick, and then there's Monsieur.

305
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,400
Courtois is absent, and then my husband is absent. Mr. Courtois is absent; he is not here.

306
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,940
He's not in Paris, he's traveling. He travels a lot. He's traveling, he travels too much. Dirty

307
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:54,000
Tired, Madame Courtois keeps telling him to be careful, she says, "Be careful."

308
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,320
"Be careful," she repeats to him every day, "it's the..."

309
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:08,220
The verb to repeat: I repeat it every day, you should pay attention

310
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,020
Be careful, it's going to end badly, but he's not paying attention.

311
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,520
Marie-Laure doesn't pay attention either.

312
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,940
And it ends badly.

313
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,200
Be careful

314
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,580
But you can't be careful, can you?

315
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,300
This too will end badly.

316
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,320
Stop

317
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,580
Warning, this is going to end badly.

318
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,400
This too will end badly.

319
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
Do you see?

320
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It ended badly

321
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,640
This too will end badly.

322
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,700
You see, it ends badly.

323
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,820
That too ends badly.

324
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,360
This will end badly. You'll give me a heart attack.

325
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,500
A heart attack, a stroke, a cardiac infarction.

326
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
There you have it, Mr. Courtois is having a heart attack.

327
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,220
He doesn't listen to her. He laughs.

328
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,600
He laughs. Look at Marie-Laure here.

329
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,980
She laughs. And here, she cries.

330
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:20,640
She laughs, he laughs too, they're all the same, men, don't even talk to me about them, they're all the same.

331
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,740
Women, don't talk to me about it, they're all the same, nor about a dinner the day after tomorrow, just you

332
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,300
Do you have the address? It's next to Nico's, the Japanese hotel, 59 Quai de Grenelle. That's the address.

333
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:42,000
Listen, can I ask for your address? The 7th arrondissement, the Courtois, they live in the 15th arrondissement.

334
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,500
on the banks of the Seine near the Eiffel Tower, opposite the Maison de la Radio and the statue

335
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:58,060
In the Liberty district, a rather modern neighborhood, Madame Courtois invites Robert to dinner the day after tomorrow.

336
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,060
The day after tomorrow? That's it! I don't have an audit or the day after tomorrow, quite simply.

337
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,060
We'll be so happy to see you. So, is that settled?

338
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
Okay, it's a deal.

339
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
So, it's afternoon at 2 o'clock.

340
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Okay, it's a deal.

341
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Robert is going to have lunch on a terrace.

342
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:19,060
He orders a plate of country ham and a glass of Beaujolais.

343
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Beaujolais is a red wine from a region near Burgundy.

344
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:34,520
Then Robert goes on a date with Marie-Laure; she gives him a ball of gum.

345
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:44,180
Do you want some? Then he sees the man in black. Marie-Laure asks Robert if he knows him. Do you know him?

346
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:51,800
No, but earlier at the farmhouse I went to make a phone call and he came down behind me.

347
00:24:51,800 --> 00:25:06,320
He went to make a phone call, he went downstairs, he came in, he stayed, he went out, he went upstairs

348
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:16,360
Notice that all these verbs are conjugated with the auxiliary verb "être bon" (to be good). Now listen.

349
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:25,840
Look, think, and speak. Look at Mireille here; she takes her time, or she hurries.

350
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,540
She's hurrying, why is she hurrying? She's hurrying because she... because she's going

351
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:39,800
Being late, that's money or a bill, that's a bill, and that's money or a

352
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:47,300
A ticket is money, look at Marie-Laure, the chocolates, she hates them or it makes her

353
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:58,280
Pleasure, it pleases him, look at these people, they are traveling or at home, they are in

354
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:05,880
On a trip. Look at Marie-Laure. Is she laughing or crying? She's laughing. And here? She

355
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,320
He cries. What is this? Breakfast or lunch? It's breakfast.

356
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,980
Lunch. And is that breakfast or lunch? It's lunch. And

357
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:25,060
What time is it? Noon, who said so, the little mouse? The little mouse, the little

358
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,260
Mouse? Is there a mouse here? Where is it?

359
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,120
At the chapel.

360
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,140
At the chapel? Oh, okay.

361
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,140
No way! She's here!

362
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
Oulah! Oulah! Oulah! Oulah!

363
