2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,460
Watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,020
Pretty soon you will figure out what's going on

4
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,320
and be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,980
Robert has been invited to dinner at the Courtois

6
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,060
and he tries to convince Mireille to get herself invited too.

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,960
Mireille doesn't commit herself

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,440
and Robert spends the next 48 hours wondering if she'll be there.

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,460
He then becomes hopelessly lost trying to get to the Courtois apartment.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,700
The Luxembourg Garden

11
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,980
Robert and Marie-Laure are sitting on a bench.

12
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,660
But what are you two doing here?

13
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,480
We're talking.

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,980
What's wrong with you? You look strange.

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,020
Do we look strange?

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,080
Strange, strange.

17
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,320
I called the courteous one earlier.

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,400
Oh yes ?

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,640
First, I came across a lady with a strange accent.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,340
Which I didn't quite understand.

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,480
Ah, it must have been Conception, their maid.

22
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,740
She's Portuguese. She's a gem.

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,380
She's an excellent cook.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,480
She's a remarkably good cook.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,660
My queen too, by the way.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,940
I called again a little later.

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,580
There, I met Mrs. Courtois.

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,640
I also had trouble understanding it.

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,420
However, she doesn't have a Portuguese accent, as far as I know.

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,880
No, but oh my, does she speak fast?

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,540
And how talkative she is!

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,800
Ah, that's true, she talks a lot.

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,140
But when her husband is there, he's the one who talks.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,080
She said nothing.

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,840
So when he's not there, she takes advantage of it.

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,000
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,640
Finally, it appears that Mr. Courtois is absent.

38
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,920
He is traveling.

39
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,320
Minouche is not doing well at all.

40
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,460
She has a migraine or something like that.

41
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,560
She needs to take him to the vet.

42
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,680
So they can't see me until the day after tomorrow.

43
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,380
But she invited me to dinner the day after tomorrow.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,180
That's kind.

45
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,160
He's an excellent person.

46
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,280
She has a heart of gold, and so does he, for that matter.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
He's a bon vivant.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,720
Always happy, always optimistic, he never worries.

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,920
He always repeats, don't worry, everything will be alright.

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,440
Don't worry, there won't be a problem.

51
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,400
It won't be a problem.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,260
You'll see, everything will work out, there's no need to worry.

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,880
For her, it's quite the opposite.

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,200
She is always a little tense, worried.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,500
She keeps saying, this will all end badly.

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,280
No, Grandma, you'll see, it'll all work out.

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,380
She has a passion for cats. They never had children.

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,120
He's a gourmet. He travels a lot for business.

59
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,660
He knows all the great restaurants in France.

60
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,300
And since Conception is an excellent cook, and Madame Courtois too, you eat very well at their house.

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,580
Do you enjoy good food?

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,840
Oh yes!

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,340
Well then, since Madame Courtois is your godmother, you can't avoid being asked to dinner the day after tomorrow?

64
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,740
I don't know. I don't know if I will be free.

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,440
Ultimately, it doesn't depend entirely on me.

66
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,720
I'll see.

67
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,540
Oh dear, excuse me, I'm off.

68
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,620
I'm going to be late. Goodbye.

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,180
Where is she going?

70
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,640
It's a mystery.

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,780
Would you like one?

72
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,320
Thursday, May 31st.

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,440
Robert is walking around Paris.

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,260
He walks through the flower market.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:09,220
He walks past the concierge's house, along the banks of the Seine, he looks at the animals

76
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,040
And all the while, he is nervous, tense, worried.

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,260
He wonders if Mireille will be at the Courtois' house the next day

78
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,160
Will she be at the Courtois'?

79
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,700
He enters the Louvre Museum

80
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,940
He sees a painting by a painter named Robert

81
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,420
How strange!

82
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,620
His name is Hubert Robert

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,880
Strange, strange

84
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,960
He passes by the victory of his motrasse

85
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,880
Dad, why doesn't she have a head?

86
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,220
It's the victory of his motrasse

87
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:04,040
He stops in front of the Venus de Milo.

88
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,860
Dad, why doesn't she have arms?

89
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,340
This is the Venus de Milo.

90
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,480
He goes to see the Mona Lisa, but he can only think about Mireille.

91
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,640
Will she be at the Courtois'?

92
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
Will she be at the Courtois'?

93
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,820
I don't know.

94
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,060
In the evening, Robert takes a walk in Paris.

95
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,520
He's thinking about Mireille.

96
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,480
He wonders if she will be with the Courtois.

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,520
She will be there. She will not be there.

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,440
Robert slept badly.

99
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,740
He wonders if Mireille will be at the Courtois'.

100
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,940
He opens his window.

101
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,620
The weather is magnificent

102
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,980
She will be there

103
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,380
He shaves and cuts himself

104
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,540
She will not be there

105
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,000
It is 9 o'clock in the morning

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,380
Dinner at the Courtois' is at 7:30 in the evening.

107
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,380
Robert is going for a walk to pass the time

108
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,200
He goes around the island of Saint-Louis

109
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,780
He passes in front of the town hall.

110
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,480
He explores the Forum des Halles.

111
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,140
He visits Beaubourg, the Pompidou Centre.

112
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,380
And they wonder if Mireille will be at the Courtois' house tonight.

113
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,860
Three hours.

114
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,580
Robert returns to his hotel and changes his clothes.

115
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,840
and will take the subway to go to the Courtois' house.

116
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,480
He looks a little lost.

117
00:07:47,860 --> 00:08:08,420
He gets off the subway.

118
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,300
He sees the Arc de Triomphe.

119
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,660
That's not it.

120
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,140
He takes the subway again.

121
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,020
Look at his plan.

122
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,420
Seems increasingly lost.

123
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,920
He gets off the subway.

124
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,960
Oh dear, poor Robert, that doesn't seem to be it.

125
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,460
Miss, please, the Totem Tower.

126
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,680
I don't know. You're in the defense area here. It's not this way, I don't think.

127
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,740
THANKS.

128
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Excuse me, the Quai de Grenelle, please. The Totem Tower is this way.

129
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,200
The Quai de Grenelle, but that's in the 15th arrondissement. Here, you are in Montmartre.

130
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,380
you have to take the subway

131
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,480
Oh no, I don't have time.

132
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,400
THANKS

133
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,580
and Robert sets off on foot

134
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,180
he walks across all of Paris

135
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,480
Montmartre

136
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,360
the Sacré-Coeur, the Moulin Rouge

137
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,760
the Opera

138
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,980
Place Vendôme

139
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:59,960
La Madeleine, la rue royale, la place de la Concorde.

140
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,640
He arrives at the Eiffel Tower at this hour.

141
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,040
He catches sight of the Statue of Liberty.

142
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Finally, here is the Quai de Grenelle.

143
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:46,680
Subtitles ST' 501

144
00:10:46,700 --> 00:11:16,680
Let's go!

145
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,660
It's ringing.

146
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,220
Excuse me, sir.

147
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,200
Madame Courtois, is this the right place?

148
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,780
Ah, no, sir. No, Madame Courtois, it's not here.

149
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,860
No, you've come to the wrong door.

150
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,680
Madame Courtois is next door. The door next door.

151
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,560
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have bothered you.

152
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,360
Excuse me.

153
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,080
It's not a problem, sir. There's no harm done.

154
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,200
Goodbye, sir.

155
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,700
It's 7:30. Phew!

156
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,380
Madame Courtois invited Robert because he called her.

157
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,180
He tried to call her several times.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,380
The first time, he didn't get Madame Courtois.

159
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,480
It was not Mrs. Courtois who answered.

160
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,260
He had someone else.

161
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,240
He found the right one.

162
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,260
First, I came across a lady with a strange accent.

163
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,660
He found the right one.

164
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,980
In New Orleans, you remember, Robert fell off a balcony.

165
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,300
Now he's found the right one.

166
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Hello, Mrs. Courtois?

167
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,680
Oh no, that's the right one.

168
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,420
Here, Mireille runs into Hubert.

169
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,140
She is surprised to meet him at university.

170
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,800
Hi, Hubert!

171
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,300
What are you doing here? I didn't expect to run into you at the Sorbonne.

172
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,460
I go there sometimes.

173
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,380
Robert stumbled upon Conception, the maid of the courtly ones.

174
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,460
She's Portuguese. She's a gem. She's an excellent cook.

175
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,520
She's a remarkably good cook.

176
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,700
This maid is a gem. Gems. A gem.

177
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,540
The maid is a pearl. She is precious. She has many qualities.

178
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,420
First of all, she's an excellent cook.

179
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,600
A cook, a female cook.

180
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,000
That's a cook who cooks. She cooks well.

181
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,720
That's a man who cooks, but he's not very good at cooking.

182
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,480
Robert had difficulty understanding Madame Courtois.

183
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
He has trouble getting up.

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,260
She too has trouble getting up.

185
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,320
Oh, but what time is it?

186
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,320
Ten past twelve, miss.

187
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,280
Please come back in one hour.

188
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,560
And this gentleman is having trouble finding his way.

189
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,540
He has difficulty walking.

190
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,520
Jean-Claude is also having a hard time.

191
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,720
And he's having trouble starting his chainsaw.

192
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,480
When you have trouble sleeping, you can take pills.

193
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,240
Look, if she has trouble sleeping, you give her two in the evening.

194
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,080
Robert had difficulty understanding Madame Courtois.

195
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,180
However, she doesn't have a Portuguese accent.

196
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,060
Unfortunately, that's not possible today.

197
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,880
Minouche is not doing very well.

198
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,380
No, I don't know what's wrong with her.

199
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,560
And I need to take him to the doctor this afternoon.

200
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,040
However, she doesn't have a Portuguese accent, as far as I know.

201
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,340
As far as I know.

202
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,420
Listen to Marie-Laure here.

203
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,240
Is your sister married?

204
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:24,820
Mireille?

205
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,420
No, not that I know of.

206
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,540
Listen to Mr. Bello here.

207
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,760
Has Marie-Laure gone out?

208
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,160
No, not that I know of.

209
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,700
She must be in her room.

210
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,560
Not that I know of.

211
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,980
Not that I know of.

212
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,960
No, Mrs. Courtois does not have a foreign accent.

213
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,200
But Robert had trouble understanding her because she speaks quickly and a lot.

214
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,140
She is very talkative. She likes to talk. She likes to chat.

215
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,820
You like to chat too.

216
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,280
When Madame Courtois speaks, Robert cannot get a word in edgewise.

217
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,880
When you speak, we cannot get a word in edgewise.

218
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,700
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

219
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,560
To place, a word. It's the verb to place.

220
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,420
Minouche is not well. She is sick. She has a migraine.

221
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,020
Minouche is not well at all. She has a migraine.

222
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,020
She has a migraine. She has a headache. He has a migraine too.

223
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,300
Are you okay? How's your head?

224
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,720
Oh, the head, a real bloodbath.

225
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,280
He has a migraine too. Look at Mr. Bello here. He has a migraine too.

226
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,560
Jean-Claude, the migraine, please.

227
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,420
Minouche is sick.

228
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,460
Mrs. Courtois needs to take him to the vet.

229
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,980
The veterinarian is the doctor for animals.

230
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,080
Mrs. Courtois loves cats very much.

231
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,160
She has a passion for cats.

232
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,360
She loves cats.

233
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
This gentleman also has a passion for cats.

234
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,240
Marie-Laure, on the other hand, has a passion for chocolates.

235
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,360
I have a passion for chocolates.

236
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,400
Ms. Courtois has a passion for cats

237
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,160
And she has a heart of gold.

238
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,720
That means she is very generous

239
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,960
She has a good heart

240
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,900
A heart, a heart, a heart, a hand

241
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,580
Heart on his sleeve

242
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,940
She has a heart of gold.

243
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,860
She is kind

244
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,600
Mr. Courtois also has a heart of gold.

245
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,360
But Mr. and Mrs. Courtois are very different

246
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,920
Mr. Courtois is a bon vivant

247
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,120
He's a bon vivant, like those people.

248
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,500
He likes to eat well, to drink well

249
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,340
He's always happy, he's an optimist

250
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,960
But don't worry

251
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,220
He's not worried, he's relaxed, at ease

252
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,500
Look at Marie-Laure here, she's relaxed too.

253
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,740
She's not worried about it

254
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,260
Well, you're not worried about it.

255
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,180
No, I'm not worried about it.

256
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,440
Why should I worry? Are you worried?

257
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,940
Yes, I have an exam tomorrow.

258
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,740
Don't worry, Henri will sort everything out.

259
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,340
Look at this gentleman, he's not worried.

260
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,980
And yet, he doesn't have a house.

261
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,900
He's worried about it, he's concerned

262
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,240
He's worried too, he's concerned

263
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,900
And he's right.

264
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,280
Jean-Claude, please don't worry about it.

265
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,580
Mrs. Courtois is worried

266
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,460
She is worried

267
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,360
This will all end badly.

268
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,020
My God, Julien, what's going on?

269
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,120
She too is worried. She's worried.

270
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,780
Mr. Courtois, however, is not worried.

271
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,520
Don't worry, there won't be a problem.

272
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,480
Don't worry.

273
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,680
Look, observe. Listen carefully.

274
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,060
Oh! I know you can't stay here!

275
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,920
But don't worry, I won't be long.

276
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,380
Ms. Courtois is still worried, tense.

277
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,860
Look, there's a tent. A pitched tent.

278
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,300
And there you have it, a relaxed tent.

279
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,220
And here's a relaxed bow. Here's a drawn bow. And here's a relaxed bow.

280
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,960
Well, Ms. Courtois is tense.

281
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,060
Here, Jean-Claude is worried, nervous, tense.

282
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,220
Mr. Courtois, on the other hand, is relaxed. He is not worried.

283
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,820
Don't worry, it'll all work out. It won't be a problem.

284
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,600
It won't make a fuss. Not a fuss.

285
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,560
That's it, it's a done deal.

286
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,820
Here, it's a no-brainer.

287
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,300
When it creases, it's not right.

288
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,500
Look at this lady.

289
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,200
She's not happy because it's creased.

290
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,800
That's not going well.

291
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,680
Here, it doesn't crease anymore.

292
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,660
She is happy.

293
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,040
How are you.

294
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,280
How are you.

295
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,460
It's a done deal.

296
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,380
Mr. Courtois is optimistic.

297
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,820
He's not worried about it.

298
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
He thinks everything will be alright.

299
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,920
Everything can be fixed.

300
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,620
Look.

301
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,520
Marie-Laure has a small problem.

302
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,960
But Uncle Guillaume will sort that out.

303
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,380
There, it's sorted.

304
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,340
You'll see, everything will work out.

305
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,820
What else is there?

306
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,280
My ball fell into the lady's bag over there.

307
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,880
Well, go ask her.

308
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,560
I don't dare.

309
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,560
Wait, I'll fix that.

310
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,280
And there you go, it's sorted.

311
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,420
You see, everything works out in the end.

312
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
No, there's no problem anymore, everything's sorted out.

313
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,100
Mrs. Courtois invited Robert to dinner

314
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Now, Robert suggests that Mireille get herself invited too.

315
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,000
Can't you get invited to dinner the day after tomorrow?

316
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
Mireille doesn't say no, but she doesn't say yes either.

317
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,840
It doesn't depend entirely on her

318
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,260
It depends first and foremost on Madame Courtois

319
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,480
And then it depends on his parents, on his job

320
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,260
It doesn't depend entirely on me.

321
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,720
We are always dependent on someone or something.

322
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,780
Take Marie-Laure, for example.

323
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,660
She is not free to go and play in Luxembourg as she pleases.

324
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,320
Do you come to play here every day?

325
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,840
It depends.

326
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,760
It depends on what?

327
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,200
It depends on the weather. If it's raining, I won't come.

328
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,040
It depends on the homework.

329
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,700
If I have any, you can't come.

330
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,080
Then it depends on mom. Sometimes she says no.

331
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,940
The next day, Robert goes for a walk in Paris.

332
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,780
He's thinking about Mireille. He's wondering if Mireille will be at the Courtois' house.

333
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,940
Will she be at the Courtois' tomorrow?

334
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,900
He wonders. He asks himself questions.

335
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,140
It's the verb "to wonder".

336
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,940
Here we have someone wondering how we got their phone number.

337
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,600
What I'm wondering is how he got my phone number.

338
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,900
Robert is wondering whether Mireille will be staying with the Courtois family.

339
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:59,000
So he goes to the Louvre Museum. He looks at the victory of his moth. A little boy wonders why it doesn't have a head.

340
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,200
Dad, why doesn't she have a head?

341
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,540
It's a victory for his motorcycle.

342
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,640
Robert, for his part, wonders if Mireille will be at the Courtois'.

343
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,520
Then he sees the Venus de Milo. The same little boy wonders why she doesn't have arms.

344
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,680
Dad, why doesn't she have arms?

345
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,760
This is the Venus de Milo.

346
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,400
It's obvious. Everyone knows that the Venus de Milo has no arms.

347
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,180
Are you familiar with the Venus de Milo?

348
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,500
Yes.

349
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,920
What is this ?

350
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,060
It is an ancient Greek statue.

351
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,040
What's special about her? Is she missing something?

352
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,140
He's missing his arms.

353
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,040
And what is missing from the victory at Samothrace?

354
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,920
The head.

355
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,280
You see, everyone knows about the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.

356
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,780
Then, Robert sees a very pretty painting by Boucher.

357
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,940
It reminds him of Mireille.

358
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,320
He wonders if she will be with the Courtois.

359
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,840
Then he sees Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.

360
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,680
He smiled at her and she smiled back.

361
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,400
It reminds him of Mireille.

362
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
And he wonders if she will be with the Courtois.

363
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,460
The following morning, Friday, June 1st, Robert slept poorly.

364
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,820
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's asleep.

365
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,280
Look at Robert here. He's sleeping on a bench.

366
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,080
She sleeps. She sleeps. He sleeps.

367
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,820
Are you asleep now?

368
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,400
You can turn on the light, Jeanne, I'm not asleep.

369
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,740
He's sleeping. That's the verb "to sleep." Observe this little scene.

370
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:59,240
You will sleep there. You will be very comfortable. Good night.

371
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,460
Thank you. You too.

372
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,580
Good night.

373
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,280
Okay, sorry, I slept badly last night.

374
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,860
Robert slept poorly because he wondered if Mireille would be at the Courtois' house.

375
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,860
He gets up, opens the window, the weather is beautiful

376
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,280
The sky is blue, the birds are singing, there are flowers

377
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,760
Everything's fine, everything will be fine, Mireille will be at the Courtois'.

378
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,540
He cuts himself, everything goes wrong, Mireille won't be at the Courtois' house.

379
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,260
Robert is going to Beaubourg

380
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,640
He visits the Pompidou Centre

381
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,940
At three o'clock, he returns to his hotel.

382
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,400
He changes his clothes to go to the Courtois' house

383
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
He checks the Courtois' address

384
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,580
And he gets on the subway

385
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,960
He is mistaken, he is lost

386
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,680
He goes out to the star

387
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,260
He sees the triumphal arch

388
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,300
That's not it, he made a mistake.

389
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,280
He heads back into the subway

390
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,080
He goes out on defense

391
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
That's not it.

392
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,800
He made another mistake. He went back on the metro and got off at Montmartre.

393
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,500
He asks a young man for directions. Robert doesn't want to take the subway.

394
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,400
He is afraid of getting lost again and arriving late at the courtly house.

395
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,900
So he sets off on foot. He crosses all of Paris on foot.

396
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,580
Finally, he finds the Totem Tower.

397
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:33,020
He goes in, takes the elevator, rings the bell, and wonders if Mireille will be there.

398
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:38,980
Ah, but that's not Madame Courtois, he's gone to the wrong door

399
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,300
You've come to the wrong door, it's next door

400
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,020
Excuse me sir, I'm sorry to have bothered you.

401
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,400
It's alright sir, there's no harm done.

402
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,700
Goodbye, sir.

403
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,300
There's no harm in it.

404
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,160
Excuse me, excuse me, I hope I didn't hurt you.

405
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,540
No, there's no harm done.

406
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,620
Now it's your turn to speak.

407
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,520
Try to answer Robert

408
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,920
Excuse me sir, I'm sorry to have bothered you, excuse me

409
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,540
It's alright sir, there's no harm done.

410
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay, now it's your turn, answer Robert.

411
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,620
Excuse me sir, I'm sorry to have bothered you, excuse me

412
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,280
It's alright sir, there's no harm done.

413
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,800
It's not a problem, sir. There's no harm done.

414
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,940
It's not a problem, sir. There's no harm done.

415
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,380
Okay, now listen, watch, think, and speak.

416
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
Let's see what you've learned.

417
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,560
Do you know what that is?

418
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,760
It's a gem.

419
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,220
And that's the good one, the good one of the courteous.

420
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,120
Look at Marie-Laure here. What is she doing?

421
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,640
Is she working or sleeping?

422
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,380
She is asleep.

423
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,540
Look at Mr. Courtois. Is he worried or is he relaxed?

424
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,900
He is relaxed.

425
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,320
And what about Mrs. Courtois?

426
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,580
This will all end badly.

427
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,580
Is she worried or is she relaxed?

428
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,820
She is worried.

429
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,060
Look at Rodin's Thinker, over there.

430
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,980
He looks worried, tense, nervous.

431
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,140
Do you know why?

432
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,140
He wonders if Mireille will be at the Courtois'.

433
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,140
And Robert, look at Robert.

434
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,140
Well, Mr. Robert, you seem quite nervous.

435
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,140
I am worried, Mr. Guignol.

436
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,140
What is it, Mr. Robert? What's wrong?

437
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,140
I wonder if Mireille will be at the Courtois'.

438
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,140
Yes, Mr. Robert, she will be there.

439
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,360
Ah, you'll see, everything will be fine, don't worry.
