00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Good morning, ladies, good morning, young ladies, good morning, gentlemen.

4
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,860
Today, we are going to profile the young man in the story, Robert.

5
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,180
He's American.

6
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,320
He's a solid boy.

7
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,360
You mean he's fat?

8
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,060
No, not at all, he's not fat, no.

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,080
It is solid, robust, sturdy.

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,720
He's not fat at all.

11
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,620
Obelix is ​​fat. He has a big belly.

12
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,740
But Robert has no belly.

13
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,620
He has no belly at all.

14
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,880
In fact, he's rather thin.

15
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,780
He is 1.70 m, 1.71 m tall,

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,340
and it weighs exactly 70 kg.

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,220
He is taller than Mireille.

18
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,880
Mireille is 1.63 m, 1.64 m, maybe no more.

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,960
At 1.70 m, Robert is taller than her

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,600
Or, if you prefer, she is shorter than him.

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,460
She is shorter than him

22
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,480
He is very athletic

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,980
He does water skiing, surfing, polo, and football.

24
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,160
American, of course, since he is American

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,580
He plays basketball, volleyball, handball, hockey, and roller skates.

26
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,740
Is that all?

27
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,120
Yes, indeed. We need to give him some time to work.

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,820
Or to take a nap.

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,560
Let's return to his physical description.

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,560
He is thin, but he is a sturdy boy.

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,720
He has broad, square shoulders.

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,180
He has a square chin.

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,700
Now, is he blond, red-haired, brown-haired, or white?

34
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,340
What do you prefer, madam?

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,780
A blond Robert?

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,640
Blanc.

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,960
Ah, that's a shame, that's a shame

38
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,140
Because I think Robert is going to be dark-haired

39
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,740
Yes, he is dark-haired, he has black hair

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,400
Personally, I prefer white or grey hair.

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,480
It's more serious, more distinguished

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,020
Yes, it's true, grey hair is very distinguished

43
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,120
But not for Robert, come on!

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,700
He is a young man, he has black hair

45
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,240
And what about the eyebrows? Will they be brown, red, or blond?

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,680
Blondes.

47
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,360
Blonde eyebrows with black hair?

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,040
No, madam, no, it won't do, it won't do at all.

49
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,980
With black hair, you need black eyebrows. It's elementary, you know.

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,240
Damage.

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,700
Yes, madam, it's a shame, but that's how it is. Robert is going to have black eyebrows.

52
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,200
Black. Is black thin or thick?

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,420
Thick. He's a solid boy.

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,620
Very well. Robert is going to have thick, black eyebrows. Well, quite thick.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,820
Now, is Robert going to grow a mustache?

56
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Do you prefer Robert with or without a moustache?

57
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,860
Which do you prefer? With or without?

58
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,340
Without.

59
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,080
Very well. It's settled. Robert is not going to grow a moustache.

60
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,380
But will he grow a beard?

61
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,040
Which do you prefer? With or without?

62
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,460
So, what do you decide?

63
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,560
A beard or no beard?

64
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,480
No beard.

65
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,780
No beard?

66
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,200
Okay, that's settled. Robert isn't going to have a beard.

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,380
and the eyes.

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,340
Will Robert have blue eyes?

69
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,860
Black?

70
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,980
Not really.

71
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,660
He's going to have brown eyes.

72
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,920
So there you have it, Robert has no belly.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,760
No beard, no moustache,

74
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
no grey hair,

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,520
But he has broad shoulders.

76
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,840
black hair,

77
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,320
black eyebrows,

78
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,300
brown eyes.

79
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:26,500
So much for the physical. Now for the mental aspect. Let's see. Will he be quick-witted too?

80
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,280
No, he's going to be stupid.

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:38,580
Oh no, he's going to be intelligent. He's going to be quick-witted too. A little less quick-witted than Mireille, if you will.

82
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,100
But he's not going to be stupid, no.

83
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,600
He is sociable, but he talks less than Mireille.

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,240
He is also less mocking than she is.

85
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,860
Mireille is very mocking.

86
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes, that's true then.

87
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,040
Robert is less mocking.

88
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,500
He is more lenient.

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
In short, they are very different.

90
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
Mireille is rather short.

91
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,820
Robert is taller.

92
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,360
She is blonde, he is brunette

93
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,120
She goes ice skating, he goes roller skating

94
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,940
She has blue eyes, he has brown eyes

95
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,720
She is very mocking, he is less so.

96
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,580
She is very lively, he is calmer

97
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,760
What will come of their meeting?

98
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,340
Ah, because you think that in the story, the young man is going to meet the young girl

99
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:46,760
Yes, perhaps. The young man will meet the young woman, or the young woman will meet the young man. Anything is possible.

100
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:55,340
What do you think the meeting will yield? Will it yield something like this? Or will it yield something like this?

101
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:02,420
Or will it turn out something like this? Or will it turn out something like this?

102
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,340
You little fool!

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,180
You idiot!

104
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,920
Seriously!

105
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,800
That's not right, is it?

106
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
Anything is possible. Chance plays such a large role.

107
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,320
Today, we are profiling the young man.

108
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,640
A very nice young man who is American and whose name is Robert.

109
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,980
Yes, Robert.

110
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,680
Because it's a very pretty name that is both French and American.

111
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,600
So this Robert, he's a solid guy.

112
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,520
He's not sturdy.

113
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
But Robert is solid

114
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,660
It doesn't mean fat, no, no, no, no

115
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,380
Obelix, on the other hand, is a bit fat, yes

116
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,740
This gentleman is also quite fat.

117
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,940
He too is rather fat

118
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,640
This gentleman is also rather fat, yes

119
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,480
And this lady, she's quite fat too.

120
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,500
She is a little overweight

121
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,680
She too is rather fat

122
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,060
This one is quite large too

123
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,280
That's a big lady too.

124
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,460
And that's a big car.

125
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,560
But no, that's not a big car, it's a small car.

126
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,780
A big car, a small car.

127
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
That's a big truck.

128
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,260
That's a big truck too.

129
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,080
And these are small trucks.

130
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,200
A big dog, a tiny little dog.

131
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,880
A small head, a big head.

132
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,260
Big, fat.

133
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,280
That's a big belly.

134
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:46,460
This gentleman has a big belly. But Robert doesn't have a belly. He's slim. He's quite tall. Oh, not very tall, but quite tall.

135
00:08:46,460 --> 00:09:14,680
Let's see, we'll measure Robert. Well, he's 1.70 m. Maybe 1.71 m. 1.100 m. 1.50 m. 1.60 m. 1.65 m. 1.66 m. 1.67 m.

136
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:23,440
One meter sixty-eight, one meter sixty-nine, one meter seventy, one meter seventy-one.

137
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,560
He is one meter seventy-one tall and weighs seventy kilos.

138
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,040
You'll see, we're going to weigh Robert.

139
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:52,460
Sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, eighty-seventy, he weighs seventy kilos.

140
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,040
Excuse me sir, how tall are you?

141
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,860
One meter sixty-seven, I think.

142
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,280
Would you say you're rather tall or rather short?

143
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,960
Rather small.

144
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,760
And how much do you weigh?

145
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,440
Ah, 69 kilos.

146
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,560
Would you say you're rather fat or rather thin?

147
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,140
Rather large.

148
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,500
How tall are you, miss?

149
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,400
1,62 m.

150
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,200
How much do you weigh?

151
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,360
45 kilos.

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,660
Would you say you're rather fat or rather thin?

153
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,500
Rather thin.

154
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,380
Let's see, let's study these numbers a little.

155
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,660
Listen to Marie-Laure, who can't sleep.

156
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:50,640
65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80.

157
00:10:50,640 --> 00:11:13,820
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

158
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,560
20, 21, 22, 23, etc.

159
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:50,620

320
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,240
It's possible.

321
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,640
It's a matter of chance.

322
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,700
Look, roulette is a game of chance.

323
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:16,280
Dice are a game of chance, too. So is the lottery. The young woman and the young man might meet. It's possible. Anything is possible. Chance plays such a vast role.

324
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:43,780
Okay, let's get down to business. For example, the differences between masculine and feminine. Observe. A dark-haired boy, a dark-haired girl. A slender finger, a slender leg. A slender finger, a slender leg.

325
00:23:43,780 --> 00:24:13,760
Now it's your turn.

326
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:30,780
Redhead, wheel, serious, serious, mocking, mocking, sporty, sporty, lively, lively, widow, widower.

327
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,180
What is this?

328
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,500
He is a young man.

329
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,560
Who is this?

330
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,520
This is Robert.

331
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,060
What is this?

332
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,020
She is a young girl.

333
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,300
Who is this?

334
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,560
This is Mireille.

335
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,780
What is this ?

336
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,900
He is a young man.

337
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,240
Who is this?

338
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
This is Hubert.

339
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,780
Now, let's see, in the story, who is going to be blond?

340
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,780
The young man or the young woman?

341
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,920
The young girl.

342
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,780
Who's going to be brunette?

343
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,380
The young man.

344
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,780
What will the young man become?

345
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,080
Brown.

346
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,780
What will the young girl become?

347
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,800
Blonde.

348
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,560
Damage.

349
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,620
For what ?

350
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,280
Because I prefer brunettes.

351
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,160
Too bad for you. She's blonde. Robert, on the other hand, is dark-haired.

352
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,120
Damage.

353
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:21,880
For what?

354
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,800
Because I prefer white ones.

355
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,720
Oh well, too bad for you. He's dark-haired and has brown eyes.

356
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,960
Damage.

357
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:30,800
For what?

358
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,140
Because I prefer blue eyes.

359
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,120
Oh well, too bad for you. He doesn't have blue eyes.

360
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,260
But Mireille has blue eyes and long hair.

361
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,020
Damage.

362
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,680
And why?

363
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,020
Because I prefer short hair.

364
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,660
Well, too bad for you. She has long hair.

365
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,940
Okay, well, to finish, let's recap.

366
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,760
Mireille and Robert don't look very much alike.

367
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,720
In fact, they are very different.

368
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,800
Mireille is short. Robert is taller.

369
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,060
She is blonde. He is brunette.

370
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:17,160
She has blue eyes and he has brown eyes; they might meet.

371
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,680
Mireille might meet Robert, it's possible, and what is the

372
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,780
The meeting will give, it might give something like that or

373
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,360
It will turn out something like this, or the encounter will produce something

374
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:41,040
Something like that, no, but that's not right, no, stop, stop, stop, or I'll arrest you, come on, come on
