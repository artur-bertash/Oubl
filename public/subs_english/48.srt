00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,020
Pretty soon you will figure out what's going on

4
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,240
and be able to say a few things

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,320
in French yourself.

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,500
Marie-Laure has gone out and not returned.

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,500
Mireille panics.

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,040
She and Robert search in vain,

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,840
but Marie-Laure finally comes back.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,860
She tells a wild tale about following

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,980
a fugitive man in black,

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,980
then losing him in the catacombs of Paris.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,920
Mireille doesn't believe a word.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,760
Among the Bélots

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,240
It is after 6 a.m.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,100
And Marie-Laure didn't come back.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,940
Mireille attend

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,140
And she's worried

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,140
But what is she doing?

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,140
But that's impossible, what could she possibly be doing?

21
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,580
My God, something must have happened to him.

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,300
Around 7 p.m., she decided to call Robert.

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,860
Hello, Mr. Taylor, please.

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,680
Hello Robert, is that you? Is Marie-Laure with you?

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Marie-Laure? No, why?

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,180
I don't know what to do, she's disappeared.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,140
But what could have happened to him?

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,020
She was supposed to be here at 6am, it's 7:15am, and she still hasn't arrived.

29
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,580
My God, I was thinking maybe she left with you

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,360
No, I think she went to Luxembourg

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,000
But then she should be here, I don't know what to do

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Listen, do you want me to come?

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,080
Yes

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,520
I'll be there right away

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, I'll wait for you, hurry up, goodbye

36
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:38,920
Fifteen minutes later, Robert arrived.

37
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,080
It's 7:40 am, she should have been here an hour and a half ago, I don't understand.

38
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,140
Did you look in his room?

39
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,860
But his boat isn't there.

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,460
It seems to me that she left with him earlier.

41
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,760
Let's go see what's happening in Luxembourg.

42
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,180
In Luxembourg, Robert and Mireille are searching, but there is no one left.

43
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,200
Right! Right! Right! Right!

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,180
Look at her boat! Marina!

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:20,420
Look at his boat! Oh my God, the basin, it's awful!

46
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,340
Robert and Mireille run towards the pool.

47
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:36,780
They spot blond hair in the water, but it belongs to a doll. It's a doll.

48
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,940
It's not hers, my God! Could she have passed by? What could have happened to her?

49
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,660
I should never have let her go. Apparently there's a strange guy who...

50
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,580
He was walking around the neighborhood, the concierge saw him, you think so? No, what are you going to imagine?

51
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,200
Listen, we're going to come back to your place and call the police.

52
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,480
Eight o'clock, she's been gone for three hours.

53
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
Something must have happened to him.

54
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,360
Marie-Laure!

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,280
Marie-Laure!

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,040
But at the Belots' house, Marie-Laure is sitting on her bed.

57
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,620
Marie-Laure!

58
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,180
Quietly playing with his boat.

59
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,360
Marie-Laure, what are you doing?

60
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,620
I'm fixing my boat, the ropes are all tangled up.

61
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,400
But where were you?

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,620
I just got back.

63
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,240
Oh, but it's not true, my God, it's not true!

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,620
Come on, come on, calm down.

65
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,260
You see, everything's fine.

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,040
All's well that ends well, right?

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,320
Nothing at all happened to him.

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,100
Do you want to eat?

69
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,820
I've already eaten, I want to go to bed.

70
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,200
Okay, that's it, go to bed. I'll come say goodnight later.

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,120
What could she have possibly done?

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,180
The important thing is that she's here.

73
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,320
It'll be OK ?

74
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,680
Yeah.

75
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
It was nice of you to come.

76
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,660
I was so scared.

77
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,760
Is it over?

78
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,820
Can I leave you now?

79
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,040
Are you sure you'll be okay?

80
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,300
Yeah.

81
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,840
See you tomorrow.

82
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,180
Try to sleep.

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,820
You're not going to be in great shape for your exam.

84
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,340
When is it, in the morning or the afternoon?

85
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,320
In the afternoon.

86
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,520
I should have finished by 6am.

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,600
And we have a meeting with the others at 6:30 am.

88
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,260
Where?

89
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,640
In Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in the small square near the church.

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,920
You know, right across from the two Magots.

91
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Of the two cakes?

92
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,340
Two fools, idiot.

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,820
You idiot.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,100
At the two Magots, the coffee.

95
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,300
Yes.

96
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,440
I think I see where it is.

97
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,400
Okay. See you tomorrow.

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,320
Mireille walks Robert to the door.

99
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,420
A little later, in Marie-Laure's room.

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,060
Are you in bed? Are you okay?

101
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,880
So tell me now, what happened to you?

102
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,800
It's a secret.

103
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,980
So, I can't tell you.

104
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,040
Anyway, it won't do any good for me to tell you.

105
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,220
Because if I tell you, you won't believe me.

106
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,900
But if

107
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,820
But no

108
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,540
But if

109
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,920
But no

110
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,120
But if

111
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,700
Well, there you have it.

112
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,960
I went to play in Luxembourg

113
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,000
And then I saw the sister's brother

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
Who was walking around with a strange look on their face

115
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,980
He seemed to be observing the house, so I thought, what does he want? He doesn't have

116
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:59,260
He didn't seem trustworthy; was he a thief, a spy, or something? At that moment, I think he saw me.

117
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:06,840
He recognized me, so he got scared and left, so I quickly hid my boat and started

118
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,000
I followed him, but I hid so he wouldn't know I was following him, and he turned around.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,400
all the time to see if I was following him, he was really scared because he suspected

120
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:33,340
Although I was following him, he left the garden, crossed the street, and went into the subway. I

121
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:40,040
I followed him of course and he got on the RER, me too, but not in the same carriage.

122
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,980
At Denfert, I saw him getting off, so I got off too.

123
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,520
He went outside and started walking.

124
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,200
He thought I had lost him, but he saw me.

125
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,580
Then he got really scared and he ran off at full speed.

126
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,940
He rushed into the first open door he saw.

127
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,920
In front of the door, there was a man in uniform shouting

128
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,120
Let's hurry for the last visit

129
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,200
I quickly entered

130
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,420
It was completely black, you couldn't see anything.

131
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,040
Then the man in uniform came in.

132
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,460
He closed the door and said

133
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,900
This way, ladies and gentlemen

134
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,080
Which was silly because there was only the man in black and no lady

135
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,900
Yes, I was there.

136
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,760
But he hadn't seen me

137
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,920
I had hidden behind

138
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,880
So, he didn't know I was there.

139
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,740
He started giving tours because he was a kind of guide

140
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,880
You see

141
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,240
Are you going there?

142
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,100
It's not that way, it's right here.

143
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:09,080
There were all sorts of weird things.

144
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,380
Skulls, bones, real ones.

145
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,180
And the man in black, he was really scared because he knew I was following him.

146
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,700
Then we went back to the stairs.

147
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,360
That's it, ladies and gentlemen, the tour is over.

148
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,340
This way to the exit.

149
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,080
Don't forget the guide, please.

150
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,440
Thank you, sir.

151
00:09:48,440 --> 00:10:11,900
What are you doing here? I was waiting for you to open the door. I'm not going to spend the night here. Okay.

152
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,080
Okay, go on, get going.

153
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,280
The man in black had taken advantage of the situation to disappear.

154
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,000
So I went home.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,220
On foot, because I didn't have enough money to take the subway.

156
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,460
And besides, I wanted to get some fresh air.

157
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,220
There you go, are you happy?

158
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,120
I wonder where you get all these far-fetched stories.

159
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,800
Because you don't believe me.

160
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,760
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

161
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,520
It's always the same, you never want to believe me.

162
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,480
Well, I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

163
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,140
That's it, sleep. And don't dream too much in my darkness.

164
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,700
And tell me, I think it would be better not to tell Mom and Dad anything. Okay?

165
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,740
Okay. It's a mystery.

166
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,360
Here, pass me one to help me fall asleep.

167
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,720
Hold.

168
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,680
Marie-Laure was supposed to be there at 6 o'clock.

169
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,040
It's 6:30 and she's not home yet.

170
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,100
Mireille is worried.

171
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,260
She wonders where Marie-Laure is.

172
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,920
But what is she doing?

173
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,820
But that's impossible. What could she possibly be doing?

174
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,960
But what could she have possibly done?

175
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,640
What are you doing here?

176
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
But what are you doing here?

177
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,180
But what are you doing?

178
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,520
My God, something must have happened to him.

179
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,840
Eight o'clock, she's been gone for three hours.

180
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600
Something must have happened to him.

181
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,340
But what could have happened to him?

182
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,820
What happened to you?

183
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,120
Nothing at all happened to him.

184
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,860
Yes, something must have happened to him.

185
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,680
Look.

186
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,020
But what happened to you?

187
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,580
I fell into the pool.

188
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,880
Look at that cyclist, something's going to happen to him.

189
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,920
That's it, something has happened to him.

190
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,420
Be careful Robert, an accident can happen so quickly.

191
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,440
There you go, it's happened

192
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,420
Oh no, nothing happened to him.

193
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,260
But a small misfortune befell Mireille

194
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,380
Shit

195
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,260
Look at Uncle William here

196
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,940
He has no idea what's going to happen to him

197
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,500
He too

198
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,380
He has no idea what's going to happen to him.

199
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,540
Mireille is very worried.

200
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,480
She is looking for Marie-Laure and she cannot find her.

201
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,060
She wonders where she has gone.

202
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,260
But my God, where could she have gone?

203
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,840
But what could have happened to him?

204
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,440
Here, it's Marie-Laure who's looking for her Asterix.

205
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,580
She wonders where he has gone.

206
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,260
But she finds it.

207
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,360
Ah, there he is.

208
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,680
He's looking for his cheese.

209
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,540
But where did he go?

210
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,540
And the sauerkraut, where did it go?

211
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,840
Marie-Laure's boat is not in her room.

212
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,060
But his boat isn't there.

213
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,300
So, she went to play in the Luxembourg pond.

214
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,960
It seems to me that she left with him earlier.

215
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,220
Let's go see what's happening in Luxembourg.

216
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,700
The boat is there, but not Marie-Laure.

217
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,160
Look at his boat.

218
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,320
She must have drowned, like Victor Hugo's daughter.

219
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,900
Oh my God, the basin, it's awful.

220
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,600
Indeed, blond hair is floating on the water.

221
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:40,560
Robert, with heroic calm, plunges his hand into the water and pulls out a doll.

222
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,400
It's a doll.

223
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,720
This is not Marie-Laure. This is not even Marie-Laure's doll.

224
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,660
It doesn't belong to her.

225
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,740
The problem is not solved. Mireille feels guilty. It's her fault.

226
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,220
I should never have let her go.

227
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,700
We're going to come back to your place and call the police.

228
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,700
You should always call the police in serious cases.

229
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:09,180
But when they arrive at the apartment, Marie-Laure is there, playing quietly in her room, as if nothing had happened.

230
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,080
Marie-Laure, what are you doing?

231
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,380
I'm fixing my boat, the ropes are all tangled up.

232
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,200
But where were you?

233
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,380
I just got back.

234
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,620
She doesn't give much detail. Strange, strange.

235
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,360
But Mireille isn't paying attention. She's too emotional.

236
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,640
But it's not true, my God, it's not true!

237
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,120
Robert tries to calm her down.

238
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,800
Calm down. You see, everything's fine.

239
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,920
All's well that ends well, right?

240
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,460
Mireille offers the solution for all tragic situations.

241
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,880
Do you want to eat?

242
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,760
But with Marie-Laure, it doesn't work.

243
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,660
I've already eaten, I want to go to bed.

244
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,640
She's very strong, that little girl.

245
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,700
Finally, all's well that ends well, as Robert says.

246
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,980
Marie-Laure is here, nothing has happened to her.

247
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,020
Robert arrived, and Mireille was very moved.

248
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,600
Everything is going very well.

249
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,340
It was nice of you to come.

250
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,400
I was so scared.

251
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,120
Emotions are good, they bring us closer together.

252
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,800
Listen to the conversation between Mireille and Robert.

253
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,740
Next, you will play the role of Robert.

254
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,460
It was kind of you to come. I was so scared.

255
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,700
It's over. I can leave you now.

256
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,760
It's going to be okay, are you sure? It's over.

257
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,000
I can leave you now. It'll be alright, you're sure.

258
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,240
It's over

259
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,620
I can leave you

260
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,440
It'll be alright, are you sure?

261
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,240
Well, that's it, then.

262
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,600
Robert left.

263
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:46,960
See you tomorrow

264
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,940
But he doesn't leave

265
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,560
He hasn't quite finished reassuring Mireille yet.

266
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,260
Try to sleep

267
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,180
He gives good advice

268
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,140
Try to sleep

269
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,880
Try to sleep

270
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,140
"You need to sleep better, Charlotte."

271
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,740
He is not leaving yet. His concern prevents him from leaving.

272
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,840
"You're not going to be in great shape for your exams."

273
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,800
Mireille has an exam to take tomorrow.

274
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,760
But with all her emotions, she's not going to be in good shape.

275
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,600
In good shape, remember?

276
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,020
Look at Guylaine here. She's not well.

277
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,260
But here, she's in good shape.

278
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,780
Jean-Claude is not in good shape here.

279
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,080
But here, he's in good shape.

280
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,900
No, but you're really in great shape, aren't you?

281
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,860
But he's not in great shape.

282
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,880
Day of a crusher.

283
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,480
Oh, you don't look very well.

284
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,400
Mireille and Robert have a meeting with their friends at the small square opposite the Deux Magots.

285
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,960
Your two cakes?

286
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,360
The two wise men, idiot.

287
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,840
You idiot.

288
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,120
At the two Magots, the coffee.

289
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,740
He's leaving.

290
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,600
Okay, see you tomorrow.

291
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,460
And Mireille returns to Marie-Laure's room.

292
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,160
She's still a little worried.

293
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,880
Are you in bed? Are you okay?

294
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,600
She wants to know what happened.

295
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,800
So tell me now, what happened to you?

296
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,980
But Marie-Laure doesn't want to tell him.

297
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,120
It's a secret.

298
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,300
So, I can't tell you.

299
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,720
She can't say because it's a secret.

300
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:33,720
And anyway, it's pointless for her to tell him, because if she did, Mireille wouldn't believe her.

301
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,200
Anyway, it won't do any good for me to tell you, because if I tell you, you won't believe me.

302
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,060
Yes, it does.

303
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,220
In fact, she really wants to tell her story.

304
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,020
Well, there you have it.

305
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,280
She went to play in Luxembourg and she saw a strange guy who seemed to be watching the house.

306
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,600
She said to herself

307
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,880
What does he want?

308
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,940
He doesn't look clean.

309
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,660
He doesn't look clean.

310
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,720
He's strange, unsettling

311
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,200
We must be wary.

312
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,480
Here, it's Marie-Laure who doesn't seem quite right.

313
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,760
Your earrings?

314
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,340
No, which earring?

315
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,460
The weird guy saw Marie-Laure

316
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,520
He recognized her

317
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,740
And he saw that she had seen him

318
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,560
So he got scared and he left

319
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,780
Marie-Laure decided to follow him in hiding.

320
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,200
But first, she hid her boat

321
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,440
She hides her chocolates

322
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,380
She hides her notebook

323
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,440
He too is hiding

324
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,620
And there, you see Marie-Laure?

325
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,360
No, because it's hidden behind the sofa.

326
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,040
She hid to scare Mireille.

327
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,780
Idiot!

328
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,800
And here, she hides to follow the man in black without him seeing her.

329
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,780
So I quickly hid my boat and started to follow him,

330
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,320
but by hiding so that he wouldn't know I was following him.

331
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,780
And he turned around.

332
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,220
He turned around.

333
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,380
She turns around.

334
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,440
He turns around.

335
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,380
He turns around. Jean-Claude, turn around.

336
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,020
Here, it's the car that flips over.

337
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,640
Here, Robert and Mireille are leaving the Sorbonne.

338
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,100
And here, Robert returns.

339
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,080
The man in black kept turning around.

340
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,240
And he kept turning around to see if I was following him.

341
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,360
Are you following me?

342
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,280
No, Mireille is not following Marie-Laure's story very well.

343
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,380
In any case, she doesn't believe it's true.

344
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,320
He was really scared because he suspected I was following him.

345
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:04,180
He was scared. He was very scared. He was terrified. Really scared. Do you remember?

346
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,540
She's really good.

347
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
It's good ?

348
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,500
Yeah, it's really great.

349
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,320
He was really scared because he suspected I was following him.

350
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,700
The man in black was afraid because he knew Marie-Laure was following him.

351
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,180
He suspected as much.

352
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,800
To suspect. Do you remember?

353
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,660
That, I have no doubt about.

354
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,820
It doesn't work. I suspected as much, I was sure of it.

355
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,020
She suspected it wouldn't work.

356
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,760
Let's return to the story of Mireille's earrings.

357
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,480
Marie-Laure, haven't you seen my earrings?

358
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,220
Your earrings? No.

359
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,640
Why? Did you lose them?

360
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,780
No, I didn't see them.

361
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,600
Take a good look at me. You don't look quite right.

362
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,480
She suspects that it was Marie-Laure who took the earrings.

363
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,100
And she's right.

364
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,780
Me?

365
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,040
There they are.

366
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,560
Yeah, I knew you'd stolen them from me.

367
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,820
You're crazy, completely crazy.

368
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,180
The normal appearance between seizures, I should have suspected as much.

369
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,780
Normal appearance?

370
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
So you couldn't have suspected it.

371
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:18,440
The man in black was very scared because he suspected that Marie-Laure was following him.

372
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,960
He suspected as much.

373
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,560
He entered the metro and then boarded the RER.

374
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,440
In Paris, there is the metro and the RER.

375
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,760
There are many subway lines.

376
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,600
Porte Cliancaux, Porte d'Orléans, Porte de la Chapelle, Méridici.

377
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:52,840
Levallois-Gallieni bridge, the metro stops often, there are many stations, there is the

378
00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:00,680
So there's the metro, and then there's the RR. The RR goes further than the metro; it's faster than the metro.

379
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:10,460
And he stops less often. The man in black got off at Denfert-Rochereau. He had seen that

380
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:16,400
Marie-Laure was following him, so he got very scared and rushed into the first door.

381
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,960
open door that he saw. In front of the door there was a man in uniform shouting, "Hurry us up for the

382
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:35,300
On my last visit, I quickly went in; it was completely dark, like the catacombs in the basement of

383
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:44,420
In Paris, there are the metro tunnels, the sewers, there are hundreds of kilometers of galleries...

384
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:52,100
The taste of sewage, for the whole system, you remember there are sewers and there's the subway

385
00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:05,180
And there are also the catacombs. Kilometers and kilometers of galleries that were dug to extract the stone needed for the construction of houses.

386
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:17,080
In the 18th century, the old cemeteries that were in the center of Paris were removed and the bones were placed in the galleries of the catacombs.

387
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,780
In the catacombs, there are the bones of 5 or 6 million people.

388
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,080
Come on, let's hurry up for the last visit.

389
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,520
There is a guide.

390
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,160
This way, ladies and gentlemen.

391
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,400
Don't forget the guide, please.

392
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,720
Generally, guides expect to be tipped at the end of the tour.

393
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,700
Marie-Laure was unfamiliar with the catacombs.

394
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,460
She saw skulls and bones.

395
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,260
She didn't know what it was.

396
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,540
There were all sorts of weird things.

397
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,380
She calls them things, because she doesn't really know what they are.

398
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,380
When you don't know what to call something, you say something.

399
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
What is this thing?

400
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,940
What if we bought something?

401
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,180
Marie-Laure almost let herself be locked in the catacombs.

402
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,440
But she doesn't let herself be pushed around, that little girl.

403
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,240
She knows how to manage.

404
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,460
What are you doing here?

405
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,740
I was waiting for you to open the door. I'm not going to spend the night here.

406
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,680
But when she came out, the man in black had disappeared.

407
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,960
She didn't take the subway because she didn't have enough money.

408
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,900
But also because after the catacombs, she wanted to get some fresh air.

409
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,180
Mireille is getting some fresh air and sunshine.

410
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Aunt Georgette and Fido are getting some fresh air.

411
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,380
Marie-Laure is going to get some fresh air.

412
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,700
It's suffocating in here. I need a change of scenery.

413
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,860
Mireille does not believe Marie-Laure's story.

414
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,480
I wonder where you get all these far-fetched stories.

415
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,940
She thinks it's a tall tale.

416
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,300
An extravagant, not serious story

417
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,860
A story that cannot be listened to seriously

418
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,940
So we fall asleep, we fall asleep standing up

419
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,600
Mireille doesn't believe Marie-Laure's story.

420
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,040
But she doesn't know what happened

421
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,940
She's a little worried, she feels responsible

422
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:38,400
She doesn't want her parents to know that Marie-Laure mysteriously disappeared for several hours.

423
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,500
And tell me, I think it would be better not to tell Mom and Dad anything. Okay?

424
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,360
Okay, well, let's see what you have to say.

425
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,760
Look at Jean-Claude here. Does he look tired or does he look fit?

426
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,740
He looks fit.

427
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,660
He looks well. Your little sister isn't here.

428
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,560
She should be here. What are you saying?

429
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,520
God, where could she have gone?

430
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
What is this? Did Marie-Laure drown?

431
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,240
Non.

432
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,540
It's a doll.

433
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,540
Mireille is calling you; her little sister has disappeared.

434
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,780
She is very worried, what do you say?

435
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,700
Listen, do you want me to come?

436
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,100
You were very worried

437
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,560
Robert came to reassure you, what do you say?

438
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
It was nice of you to come.

439
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,460
Your little sister tells you strange stories.

440
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,240
You don't believe her, what are you saying?

441
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,840
I wonder where you get all these far-fetched stories.

442
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,240
Oh dear, are these tall tales ever going to end?

443
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,440
I'm fed up with these ridiculous stories.

444
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm going to bed now.
