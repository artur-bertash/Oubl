00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,800
That's a tree too.

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,260
It's a dead tree.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
That's a tree too.

11
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,540
It's a Christmas tree.

12
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,760
And this is also a tree, but it's a family tree.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,940
This is Mireille's family tree.

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,860
Let's see, where is she? Do you see Mireille? Ah, there she is.

15
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,680
Let's study Mireille's genealogy.

16
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,280
Let's start with Adolphe Belleau.

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,660
In 1912, Adolphe Belleau married Eugénie Daubois

18
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,740
They have two children, Casimir and Anatole.

19
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,760
In 1937, Anatole married Jeanne Langlois

20
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,360
They have five children

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:22,480
Two girls, Georgette and Paulette, and three boys, François, Armand and Guillaume

22
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:30,580
In 1964, François Belleau married Madeleine Potier

They have three children, three daughters

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:41,880
Cécile, Mireille and Marie-Laure

25
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:51,360
If you examine the family tree, you will see that Mireille is the daughter of François and Madeleine Bello

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,580
Similarly, Cécile is the daughter of François and Madeleine Bello

27
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,680
And Marie-Laure is also the daughter of François and Madeleine Bello

28
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,600
Now, take Yvonne

29
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,580
Whose daughter is Yvonne?

30
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,180
Yvonne is the daughter of Armand and Arlette Bello.

31
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,420
Let's get back to Mireille.

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,900
Mireille is François' daughter,

33
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,420
Anatole's granddaughter

34
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,040
and the great-granddaughter of Adolphe Bello.

35
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,980
Let's take Georges now.

36
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,440
Georges is the son of Armand and Arlette Bello.

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Anatole's grandson and Adolphe's great-grandson.

38
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,700
Let's examine Mireille's maternal family.

39
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,800
Mireille has a mother.

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,440
Who is Mireille's mother?

41
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,560
This is Madeleine Belleau.

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,440
Now, who is Louise Potier?

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,420
She is Madeleine's mother and Mireille's grandmother.

44
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,420
And who is Lucie Pottier?

45
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:25,660
She is the mother of Léon Pottier, the grandmother of Madeleine Bello and the great-grandmother of Mireille.

46
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,440
Who is Édouard Pottier?

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:38,480
He is the father of Léon Potier, the grandfather of Madeleine Potier and the great-grandfather of Mireille.

48
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,560
Now, look at Cécile and Marie-Laure.

49
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,540
They are Mireille's sisters, okay?

50
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,980
And Sophie, Sophie Potier, is she Mireille's sister?

51
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,880
No, she's not his sister, she's his cousin.

52
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,980
And Philippe Potier, is he Mireille's brother?

53
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:15,060
No, he's Sophie's brother, but he's not Mireille's brother, he's her cousin.

54
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,720
Look at Henri Potier, he's Sophie's father.

55
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,980
Is this Mireille's father?

56
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,200
No, it's his uncle.

57
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,660
And Juliette Pottier is Sophie's mother and Mireille's aunt.

58
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,220
Do you want to meet Mireille's family?

Here are my father and mother. Here are my sister Cécile and her husband Jean-Denis. Everyone says they

65
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:31,180
They look like me. Marie-Laure? What? Come on. Oh, listen, I'm busy. Marie-Laure,

66
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:38,380
I'm telling you to come right away, whatever happened. Hello.

67
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,180
This is my little sister, Marie-Laure.

68
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:51,220
my cousin Georges and my cousin Yvonne

69
00:06:51,220 --> 00:07:01,480
That's my great-aunt Amélie over there. She's 70 years old and a widow; her husband died.

70
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:11,320
In the war in 1940, my poor husband next to him is my great-uncle Casimir, he's 85

71
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:20,380
He's a widower, his wife died of cancer, that's Uncle Guillaume, a brother of Dad.

72
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:28,240
At 54, he doesn't work, he's wealthy, as my Aunt Georgette says, he has hobbies

73
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,740
And he's still on vacation, that's good, it's nice to have money, he has some

74
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:44,880
Lucky Uncle Guillaume, isn't he? He has a lot of connections, a lot of connections, it's useful.

75
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,260
He has no children. Is he married? No, he is single.

76
00:07:52,260 --> 00:08:02,880
But he loves children, especially Marie-Laure.

77
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,700
Guillaume is extraordinary. He always finds time for the children.

78
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,640
Yes, yes, I know. And he always arrives with chocolates, gifts. It's easy.

79
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:22,980
When you have money, that's my aunt Georgette, my father's sister, she's 59 years old.

80
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,320
I think she doesn't have much money; she's not married, she's single too.

81
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,740
Luckily, because she hates children, even her nephews and nieces; she finds them all...

82
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:43,140
Annoying and tiring children, but deep down she's very kind and I love her very much.

83
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,900
My aunt Paulette and uncle Victor aren't here, nor are my grandparents.

84
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:57,300
Grandfather isn't doing very well, but I could show you some photos if you'd like, Marie-Laure.

85
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,200
Whatever, what is it now? Go get my album, you're bothering me, you can't go get it.

86
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
You can look for it yourself.

87
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
That's me at age 6.

88
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
That's me at 6 months old.

89
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,240
That's the announcement of my birth in Le Figaro.

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:53,160
This is the announcement of Hubert's birth; he's a friend, we have exactly the same one.

91
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,000
We were born on the same day, this is the birth announcement of Marie Laure.

92
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,040
And who is this?

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,360
That's Sophie, my cousin, on my mother's side, a potter.

94
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,360
Ah yes, Philippe's sister?

95
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,880
That's it.

96
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,260
And what's she like? Is your little cousin nice?

97
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,860
Yeah, well, she's nice.

98
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,120
But I prefer my cousins ​​Bélo, especially Georges.

99
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,720
Your cousin is pretty. How old is she?

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,360
She also has a daughter

156
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,580
I mean, is that your daughter?

157
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,840
No? Well, yes, she's my daughter, I'm her mother.

158
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,160
Yes, that's my mother

159
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,760
Two daughters, their parents, and grandparents

160
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:28,740
So, the grandson, the grandfather, the grandparents, the grandmother and the grandchildren.

161
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,760
Okay, let's get back to Mireille.

162
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,460
That's Mireille.

163
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,860
That's his father.

164
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,220
His father, yes, very good.

165
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,140
And that's his mother.

166
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
His mother, very good.

167
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,800
That's his sister.

168
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,360
Yes, that's his sister.

169
00:14:48,360 --> 00:15:04,440
That's his cousin. That's his cousin. Yes, that's his cousin. And that's... Who is it? It's not his sister, is it? It's not Cécile.

170
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:25,660
Ah, yes, that's his friend. That's his friend Colette. His friends. His sister, his sisters, his parents, his cousins. That's his aunt. His Aunt Georgette. Aunt Georgette isn't married. She's single.

171
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:39,960
And that's her uncle, her Uncle Guillaume, Uncle Guillaume. Uncle Guillaume isn't married, he's single. She's single, he's single.

172
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,800
Aunt Amélie is a widow

173
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,220
That's Aunt Amélie with her husband

174
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,160
But her husband died

175
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,080
He died in the war

176
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,340
Aunt Amélie is a widow

177
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
A widow

178
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,480
Widows, not very serious

179
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,900
Uncle Casimir is a widower

180
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,820
His wife died

181
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,500
He is a widower

182
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,180
Widower, widow

183
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,400
Look, there's a widow

184
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:18,200
This gentleman is also single

185
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,540
But he is not a widower, he is divorced.

186
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,600
But his friend is a widower.

187
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:34,200
Uncle William is rich

188
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,680
He has a fortune

189
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,900
He has money

190
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,840
There's a fortune in that suitcase

191
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,520
Uncle Guillaume does not work

192
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,180
He has hobbies

193
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,380
She has hobbies

194
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,380
He has hobbies too

195
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,440
They too have hobbies

196
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,600
They too have hobbies

197
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,940
He also has hobbies

198
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,500
They too have hobbies

199
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,220
This gentleman has hobbies, but he has no hobbies.

200
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,100
And Uncle Guillaume, on the other hand, has leisure time.

201
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,740
He has plenty of leisure time. He has time on his hands.

202
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,740
He's still on vacation.

203
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,160
Look, they're on vacation.

204
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,160
They too are on vacation.

205
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,380
They too are on vacation.

206
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,880
She's on vacation too.

207
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,360
Uncle Guillaume is still on vacation.

208
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,260
He has wealth. He has money.

209
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,440
He's lucky.

210
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,820
Marie-Laure is lucky too.

211
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,920
Choose.

212
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,220
And.

213
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
You're lucky.

214
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,460
Nine.

215
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,060
Three.

216
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,360
Nine.

217
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,860
Five.

218
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
You're lucky.

219
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,620
He's lucky too.

220
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,040
Uncle Guillaume has connections.

221
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,200
He has many connections.

222
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,300
Uncle Guillaume loves children.

223
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,240
He loves children too.

224
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,560
Uncle Guillaume always arrives with gifts.

225
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,420
Marie-Laure is lucky, she always gets presents

226
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,400
Well, you have some gifts!

227
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,580
Did you see?

228
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,460
A gift

229
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,280
He buys gifts

230
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,380
Uncle Guillaume has no children

231
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,340
Mr. and Mrs. Belleau have children

232
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,780
You have children too, I believe.

233
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,840
Yes, they have four.

234
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,100
Do you have children?

235
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,400
Oh no, no, no, I'm not married.

236
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,960
You have three children, a grown daughter and two sons.

237
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:16,520
You can see one here, the other is next door, not far away. I have three children, girls, one

238
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,740
Daughter, you also have boys, two boys, but Uncle Guillaume doesn't have any children, he doesn't have

239
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:29,780
He has no children, but he has nephews and nieces. Marie-Laure, for example, is a

240
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:36,680
Uncle Guillaume's niece. Georges is Uncle Guillaume's nephew. He too has

241
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:44,600
A nephew. You saved my nephew. Oh yes, you saved our nephew. A niece,

242
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:52,020
a nephew. Aunt Georgette has nephews and nieces, but she has no children.

243
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,920
Luckily, because she finds children annoying, the children, the gasse

244
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:08,080
Watching Cyprien, musicians, dads, stop, you're annoying me, dad, it excites me and

245
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:17,040
I'm not doing anything, I've got the Hercules, what you're annoying is annoying

246
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Aunt Georgette finds children annoying and tiring.

247
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Hey Aunt Georgette, can you fix it for me?

248
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Can you be tiring?

249
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,040
She finds all children annoying and tiring.

250
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,040
The children are annoying Aunt Georgette.

251
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,040
But the old professor doesn't bother him at all.

252
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Does it bother you that I work here?

253
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
No, no, not at all.

254
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
That doesn't bother me at all.

255
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,140
It's the verb "to annoy".

256
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,100
The children are annoying their older sister.

257
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,040
Oh, that's clever! Super clever!

258
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,500
Marie-Laure is annoying Mireille.

259
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,040
Stop! Stop, you're boring me!

260
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,960
She's bothering him.

261
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,540
Stop, you're bothering me!

262
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,560
When Mireille asks Marie-Laure to go get her album, it annoys her, it bothers her.

263
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
What? What else is there?

264
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,640
Go get my album.

265
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,660
Oh, you're bothering me!

266
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,540
It bothers her, it annoys her, because she is busy.

267
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,300
Oh, wait, I'm busy!

268
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,500
She is busy here.

269
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,860
But here, it is not occupied.

270
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,660
She is busy here.

271
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,240
Aunt Georgette is busy too.

272
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,400
Uncle Guillaume is not busy here.

273
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,360
But here, he is busy.

274
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,880
Let's take a look at Mireille's album.

275
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,240
That's a wedding invitation.

276
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,160
This is the wedding announcement for Cécile and Jean-Denis.

277
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,900
This is a death notice, for the death of great-uncle Casimir's wife.

278
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,180
That's a birth announcement.

279
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,920
This is the birth announcement for Mireille.

280
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,480
That's Mireille at birth.

281
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,480
That's the birth of Venus according to Botticelli.

282
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,960
That's the birth of the Virgin by Murillo.

283
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,880
That's a double birth

284
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,640
That's an announcement from the newspaper Le Figaro.

285
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,240
This is the announcement of Hubert's birth.

286
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,200
And this is a photo of Cécile

287
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,040
She looks a lot like Mireille

288
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,180
Everyone says she looks like me

289
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,120
They look alike

290
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,460
It's amazing how much you look like your grandmother

291
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:47,500
That's Mireille's great-great-great-grandfather.

292
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,760
Marie-Laure says that Mireille looks like her.

293
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,860
Besides, she looks just like her. Don't you think?

294
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,200
That's a picture of Sophie.

295
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,400
She's not bad.

296
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,380
Your cousin isn't bad looking.

297
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,240
She's not bad either.

298
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,620
He's not bad either.

299
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,640
Robert isn't bad either.

300
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,720
He is less well

301
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,920
He's not bad

302
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,560
She's not bad

303
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,240
But what do you think, that I have time to go to the cinema?

304
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,260
Oh, but you're bothering me!

305
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,860
She's not bad-looking, but she has a nasty temper.

306
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
She's 17 and has a terrible temper, I'm warning you.

307
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,040
There are a lot of people with bad tempers, I'm warning you.

308
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,800
Here, look

309
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,260
This man has a bad temper

310
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,700
He too has a bad temper.

311
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,960
He too has a bad temper.

312
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,920
She has a bad temper.

313
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,960
This police officer has a bad temper.

314
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,380
This one also has a bad temper.

315
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,600
He has a bad temper.

316
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,240
Okay, now listen to this conversation between Mireille and Jean-Denis,

317
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,200
and then you will play the role of Jean-Denis.

318
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,260
That's Sophie, my cousin.

319
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,860
Your cousin isn't bad looking.

320
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,740
How old is she?

321
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
Your cousin isn't bad looking.

322
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,260
How old is she?

323
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,440
Your cousin isn't bad looking.

324
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,580
How old is she?

325
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,380
She is 17 years old.

326
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,800
And he has a bad temper, I'm warning you.

327
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,260
It's true ?

328
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,260
It's true ?

329
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,260
It's true ?

330
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,640
Okay, now, look at this.

331
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,260
What is this ?

332
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,260
This is a photo of Marie-Laure in a tutu.

333
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,260
And that's Aunt Georgette and her little dog.

334
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,260
Repeat, rebel.

335
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Now, pay attention. Listen carefully.

336
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
What is this?

337
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,260
That's a house in Brittany.

338
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
And what is this?

339
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,260
That's a tree.

340
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Who is it?

341
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
That's my aunt.

342
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,260
She is very kind.

343
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,260
Who is it?

344
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,740
One person. Aunt Georgette, Uncle Guillaume, my cousin.

345
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,960
What is it? A thing, a house, a tree, a photo, a dog.

346
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,260
Who is that?

347
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,260
Who is that?

348
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,260
Who is it ?

349
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,260
Who is it?

350
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,500
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? It's all the same.

351
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:39,940
So who is it? I don't know, Mom. Who is that? Who is this? Is that your great-grandfather Adolphe?

352
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:52,100
Bello, what is it? We say it's good, but what isn't it? Obviously not.

353
00:25:52,100 --> 00:26:00,120
With a red eye, good for you now, let's see if you can answer who this is, it's the father

354
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Mireille's? No, that's her mother. Who is it? Her aunt? No, her uncle. And who's this?

355
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:20,240
Uh, who is it? We say, who is it? Oh, good, good. Well, who is it? Two young people.

356
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:27,360
And what is this?

357
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,480
Well, that's my stick.

358
00:26:50,240 --> 00:27:19,240
