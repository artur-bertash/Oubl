2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We need to watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you will be able to say a few words in French yourself.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mireille goes for a walk and Robert invites himself along.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Robert is almost lost on the subway

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
on his way to meet Mireille at the station.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But they travel by train in time.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
On the road, Mireille suggests

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that they use familiarity, progress.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,900
At 9:01 a.m. on Monday morning, the phone rang at the Bélots' house.

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,500
Mireille, who happens to be near the telephone, picks up the phone.

13
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,680
Hello ?

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,160
Hello? The Salvation Army?

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,720
Oh no, madam, it's not the Salvation Army.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,160
You have the wrong number.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,300
This is the fire station.

18
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,640
You have a wrong number.

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,920
Oh, did I dial the wrong number?

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,760
Yes, you have the wrong number, madam.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,340
Oh, excuse me, miss, excuse me.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,580
No harm done, madam, it's not serious.

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,060
Do you want the Salvation Army?

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,640
Yes, the Salvation Army.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,360
Wait, I'll check the number. Don't hang up.

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,360
Hello, ma'am?

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,280
It's 43 87 41 19.

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,480
Ah, you are very kind, miss.

29
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,540
Thank you very much, miss.

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,660
You're welcome, it's nothing. You're very welcome.

31
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,880
It's the least we can do.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,820
Goodbye, madam.

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,520
Mireille hangs up.

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,800
At 9:03, the phone rings again.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Mireille answers immediately.

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,820
Hello, this is the Salvation Army, Major Barbara speaking.

37
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,920
Hello ?

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,380
Could I speak to Miss Mireille Bello, please?

39
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,880
Is that you, Robert? How are you?

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,380
I'm fine, thank you. Are you too?

41
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,800
I... I'm calling you because the other night, Friday,

42
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,340
You told me to call you this morning.

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,160
Is...

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,280
I wanted to ask you when I could see you again.

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,320
Finally, if you wanted...

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,200
That's nice, but not today.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,960
Yes, today I have to go to Chartres.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,520
I thought you had gone to Chartres the other day

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,680
THURSDAY ?

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,900
No, I couldn't go on Thursday.

51
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,980
But I absolutely have to go today.

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,280
I should go to Chartres too.

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
The cathedral

54
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,860
Couldn't I go with you?

55
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,800
Oh, if you insist

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,040
But you know, I don't go to Chartres to see the cathedral

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,340
I'm going there to visit the museum and to speak to the curator.

58
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,800
Oh, well, that's not a problem.

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,900
I could visit the cathedral while you see this gentleman.

60
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,340
First of all, the curator is not a gentleman, it's a lady.

61
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,180
And I think you're fixing things too easily.

62
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,280
Oh, well, you know, if there were only difficulties like that, life would be easy, wouldn't it?

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,060
And how do you plan to get to Chartres? By car? By road?

64
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,020
No, I don't have a car.

65
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,120
I could rent one, if you wanted.

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,900
Oh no, it's too expensive.

67
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,120
And besides, with a rental car, I'd be too afraid of breaking down.

68
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,920
If you don't want to rent a car, let's take the coach.

69
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,200
That shouldn't be very expensive.

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,020
Oh no, the coach isn't expensive. But it's not convenient. It's not fast.

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,520
So, let's go by plane. That, at least, is fast.

72
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,140
No, come on. You can't fly to Chartres. It's too close. Chartres is too close to Paris.

73
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,420
Well then, if it's so close, let's walk. I enjoy walking.

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,000
But still, it's not far, but it's not that close either.

75
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,460
Well then, let's go by bicycle or on horseback.

76
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,280
On horseback would be nice. But I don't have the time.

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,020
So, if you're in a hurry, let's go by motorcycle.

78
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,800
I love motorcycles, don't you?

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,380
I don't know. It's a bit dangerous.

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,220
And besides, I don't have a helmet anyway.

81
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
And helmets are mandatory on motorcycles.

82
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,160
So, I suppose we can't go there by boat.

83
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,780
So, what's left?

84
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,120
The helicopter? The hovercraft?

85
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,760
There is indeed a hovercraft service between Boulogne and Dover,

86
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,260
but not between Paris and Chartres.

87
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,540
And there is no helicopter service either.

88
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,240
There are indeed the gendarmerie helicopters,

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,320
but they do not take passengers, except to transport them to the hospital.

90
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,200
So, are you going to go by train?

91
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,960
Of course, you guessed it.

92
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,580
The train, you know, is still the best option.

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,300
Great, I'll be able to take the TGV.

94
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,600
But no, come on, there is no TGV between Paris and Chartres.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,260
The TGV is going too fast, it's too close.

96
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,040
With the TGV, we will have arrived before we have left.

97
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,060
TGV or not TGV, if you would be so kind, I would gladly go with you.

98
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,820
Okay, and of course.

99
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
Meet at 11am at Montparnasse station, suburban side.

100
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
How do we get to Montparnasse station?

101
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
It's easy, you just have to take the subway.

102
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Do you believe that?

103
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
Yes, of course, why not.

104
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
The other day, I wanted to take the subway.

105
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
I got completely lost.

106
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
No kidding, that's impossible.

107
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
You can't get lost on the subway.

108
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Me too.

109
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Well, listen, it's not difficult.

110
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
You take the metro at the Odéon or Saint-Michel station.

111
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
You take the Porte de Clignancourt, Porte d'Orléans line,

112
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
direction Porte d'Orléans.

113
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,480
And be careful, you don't take the metro that goes to Porte de Clignancourt.

114
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,960
You take the one that comes from there and goes to the Porte d'Orléans.

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
And you get off at Montparnasse-Bienvenue.

116
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,840
It's simple, it's direct, there's no change.

117
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,540
You can't go wrong.

118
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,780
And you'll buy a booklet of tickets. It's cheaper.

119
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
A notebook, please.

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,880
THANKS.

121
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:26,320
On the subway, Robert, the man who gets lost everywhere.

122
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,080
Facing him were four gates and two corridors.

123
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,640
hundred kilometers of tunnels,

124
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,060
the world's largest underground network.

125
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,080
Once again, Robert will prove it

126
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,900
of its exceptional ease in getting lost.

127
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,280
Robert, the man who gets lost everywhere.

128
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,140
Finally, almost everywhere.

129
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
When Robert arrives at Montparnasse station,

130
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,320
Mireille is already here.

131
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,420
She waits for him while reading a newspaper.

132
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:52,980
Hello.

133
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
Excuse me, I'm a little late.

134
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,840
I almost got lost.

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Where is the ticket window ?

136
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,780
La-bas.

137
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm taking two first-class round trips, right?

138
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,100
No, just one ticket.

139
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,480
I've already bought my ticket.

140
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,620
And me, I travel in second class.

141
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,100
So, if you were planning, by any chance,

142
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,880
to travel in the same carriage as me,

143
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,660
You'd be better off buying a second-class ticket.

144
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,380
All right.

145
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:34,860
We have the second-year returns for Chartres, please.

146
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,600
Which way is it?

147
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,040
It's this way.

148
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,160
This way?

149
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:58,920
You need to validate your ticket.

150
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:47,160
...

151
00:08:47,160 --> 00:09:03,660
Ah Versailles, the castle, the Grand Trianon, the gates, the Hall of Mirrors, the park, the flowerbeds designed by ours, the fountains, Mother Antoinette's hamlet.

152
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,940
I should go to Versailles one of these days.

153
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,900
It would be great if I could visit this with an art history specialist like yourself.

154
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,400
I wanted to tell you, we shouldn't see you like that.

155
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,260
Can we see you?

156
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,800
Yes, we see you, we call you.

157
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,960
You know, young people use the informal "tu" form very quickly.

158
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,060
I didn't want to use the informal "tu" with you in front of the courteous people the other day because they are a bit old-fashioned.

159
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,280
But I'm used to addressing all my friends informally.

160
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,460
So, can we use the informal "tu" form?

161
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,260
Oh, by the way, my parents would love to meet you.

162
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,660
They would like to have you over for dinner one of these evenings.

163
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,880
The Courtois have spoken to them a lot about you.

164
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,820
Would Thursday evening work for you?

165
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,000
We could perhaps go to the cinema afterwards, if you like.

166
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,300
Yes, if you want.

167
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,920
I think we could use the informal "tu" form.

168
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,180
Listen.

169
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:16,720
The phone rings and nobody rushes to answer.

170
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,860
It's the telephone. The telephone rings. It's the verb "to ring".

171
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,560
Here, Robert rings at the door of the courteous ones.

172
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,480
Listen.

173
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
I think someone rang the bell.

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,740
Is it the phone or the door?

175
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,480
This is the door.

176
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,260
Now, pay attention.

177
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,980
Wait, don't hang up, the doorbell's ringing.

178
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,060
So, is that the phone or the door?

179
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,540
This is the door.

180
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,040
Listen.

181
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:53,760
The doorbell rang, is it the phone or the door? It's the door. The phone is ringing. Mireille is there.

182
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,880
She happened to be near the phone; she wasn't expecting any calls, no, she was there by chance.

183
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,940
It's a coincidence, a chance occurrence. It's like Robert here; they're not looking for Mireille, no.

184
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,940
No, no, he's just passing by. Hey Robert, are you looking for me? No, I was just passing by.

185
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,420
By chance, and indeed, chance works things out well.

186
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,560
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a light, would you? I don't know why I chose the bank.

187
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,700
Besides, I didn't really choose it; it was chance that chose it for me.

188
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,860
Life has always been more or less a matter of chance; the phone rings, who is it?

189
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,940
Robert, no, it's a lady who dialed the wrong number; she wanted the army of

190
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,060
Hi, but she did the bicycle number.

191
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,460
She dialed the wrong number

192
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,880
Oh, did I dial the wrong number?

193
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,500
Yes, you have the wrong number, madam.

194
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
Look at Robert here

195
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,760
He wants to ring the Courtois' doorbell, but he rings the wrong doorbell.

196
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,480
Excuse me, sir.

197
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,460
Madame Courtois, is this the right place?

198
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,020
Oh no, sir, no, Mrs. Courtois, this isn't it.

199
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,140
No, you've come to the wrong door.

200
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,980
And look at Joan of Arc here

201
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,760
She's fighting the wrong war

202
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,160
It's a lady who would like to see a gentleman named Tasson

203
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,440
I think she's in the wrong house

204
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,500
The lady dialed the wrong number

205
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,980
She wanted the Salvation Army

206
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,800
A Protestant charitable organization

207
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,680
Here's Mireille

208
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,740
As an officer in the Salvation Army

209
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,080
Mireille replies, just for fun.

210
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,660
That it is not the Salvation Army

211
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,340
But the fire station

212
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,260
Oh no madam, it's not the Salvation Army

213
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,760
You have the wrong number

214
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,940
This is the fire station.

215
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:49,100
Here's the fire station. A firefighter, several firefighters, very friendly. Mireille is looking for the Salvation Army number for the lady. The lady thanks her.

216
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,780
Oh, you're very kind, miss. Thank you very much, miss. You're welcome, it's nothing.

217
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,900
And taste it. Thank you, thank you Julienne for taking my turn. You're welcome, Dad.

218
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,580
The phone rings, Mireille answers it

219
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,880
Hello, this is the Salvation Army, Major Barbara speaking.

220
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,200
The device

221
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,960
Robert would like to go to Chartres with Mireille

222
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,920
I should go to Chartres too.

223
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,040
Ah, the cathedral

224
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,220
Couldn't I go with you?

225
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,140
Oh, if you insist

226
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,260
If you insist, if you absolutely want to come, you can

227
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,920
It's the expression "to hold"

228
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,660
Ah. There you go.

229
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,840
a young woman who doesn't want to

230
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,660
to stay. She doesn't want to

231
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,980
To stay. Sit down.

232
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,180
I don't want to stay.

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Observe Marie-Laure here.

234
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,500
She insists on wearing her pink dress.

235
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,180
I want to wear my pink dress.

236
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,020
Can I? Okay.

237
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,760
If you insist.

238
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,340
Okay,

239
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,900
I'm going to play. Robert

240
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,620
can go to Chartres with Mireille

241
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,520
If he insists. But

242
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,900
And Mireille is not going to Chartres to see the cathedral.

243
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,020
She knows the cathedral.

244
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,840
No, she's going to Chartres to visit the museum.

245
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,360
a small museum located next to the cathedral,

246
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,020
and speak to the museum curator.

247
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,680
That's not going to stop Robert.

248
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,700
It's not serious.

249
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,060
Oh, well, that's not a problem.

250
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,060
I could visit the cathedral while you see this gentleman.

251
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,440
And I think you're fixing things too easily.

252
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,320
You know, if there were only difficulties like that,

253
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,940
Life would be easy, wouldn't it? If there were only difficulties like this, life would be easy, wouldn't it?

254
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:42,280
Life is easy, no, life isn't easy. In reality, life is complicated and difficult because...

255
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:49,240
that there are many problems, big problems, but if there were only problems like that

256
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:57,320
Minor problems. Life would be easy. Life would be easy, that's not reality.

257
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,200
That's what would happen if all these problems didn't exist. That's the conditional tense.

258
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,720
How does Mireille plan to get to Chartres? How does she intend to go there?

259
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,960
Let's see, how can we get to Chartres? We can get there by road.

260
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:25,220
There you go, a road. A road, yes. You can go to Chartres by road. By car. By car. By car.

261
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,620
But Mireille doesn't have a car. Robert doesn't have a car either. But he could rent one.

262
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,660
I could rent one, if you want.

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,260
Oh no, it's too expensive. And besides, with a rental car, I'd be too afraid of breaking down.

264
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Mireille doesn't want a rental car because she's afraid of breaking down.

265
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,260
She would be afraid, that's the conditional of the expression to be afraid.

266
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Look at Mireille here, she's going to be scared.

267
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
Idiot!

268
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,260
You were scared, weren't you?

269
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,260
Look at this young girl, she's scared.

270
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
Don't be afraid, miss.

271
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Now look at this lady, she was scared while sleeping.

272
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,860
What's going on?

273
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,280
I was scared, Hervé.

274
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,680
With a rental car, Mireille would be afraid of breaking down.

275
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,920
Look. There's Mireille, who's broken down.

276
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,720
It broke down there too.

277
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,200
And here too, it broke down.

278
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,320
Are you experiencing a breakdown?

279
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,100
You can get to Chartres by coach or plane.

280
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,500
Or on foot. On foot.

281
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,300
Look at Robert and Mireille here. They are walking to Chartres.

282
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,960
You can also go to Chartres by bicycle.

283
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,880
Or by motorcycle.

284
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,360
But for motorcycling, you need a helmet.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,740
When working on a construction site, a helmet is also mandatory.

286
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,900
When you're a firefighter, a helmet is mandatory too.

287
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,180
When you ride a motorcycle, you have to wear a helmet.

288
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,480
Asterix has a helmet, but Mireille doesn't.

289
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,560
So, she can't go to Chartres by motorcycle.

290
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,960
Is it possible to go to Chartres by boat?

291
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,700
No, it's not possible. You can't go there by boat.

292
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,380
So what? What's left?

293
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,120
The helicopter?

294
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,460
No, there is no helicopter service between Paris and Chartres.

295
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,300
There are indeed the gendarmerie helicopters.

296
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,920
The gendarmerie, which is responsible for traffic enforcement, has helicopters.

297
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,000
But the gendarmerie helicopters do not take passengers

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,280
Look at this small plane, it can take passengers

299
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,880
How many passengers can it carry?

300
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,440
Two or three probably

301
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
The pilot has two or three passengers

302
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,520
But this plane can take 200 or 300 passengers

303
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:07,000
"The gendarmerie's helicopters do not carry passengers, except to transport them to the hospital."

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,940
So, what's left? The hovercraft?

305
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,560
There you have it, a hovercraft.

306
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,540
There is indeed a hovercraft service between France and England, between Boulogne and Dover.

307
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,260
but there is no hovercraft service between Paris and Chartres.

308
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,940
But then, but then, what's left?

309
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,000
How will Mireille get to Chartres? By train?

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,200
Yes, of course, but you know, you guessed it. The train, you know, is still the best option.

311
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,840
What is the best way to get to Chartres?

312
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,800
It's about taking the train.

313
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,460
Yes, by train. I don't know if you can go by plane.

314
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,460
By hovercraft, certainly not, no.

315
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,540
The train, you know, is still the best option.

316
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,420
This is the best. It's excellent. You can't find better.

317
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,240
This is what we do best. You won't find better.

318
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,040
The train is the best option. It's fast, convenient, comfortable, and always on time.

319
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,960
Ah, that's very good. And then, you meet people on the train. You make acquaintances.

320
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,340
I like the train. You meet people.

321
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,340
There are extremely fast trains, like the TGV, the fastest train in the world.

322
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,980
Mireille arranges to meet Robert at Montparnasse station.

323
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:30,040
This is a large train station in Paris. A train station. A train station. There's a train station. There's the train station in Montreal, Canada.

324
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,860
This is Chartres station. Chartres station. Saint-Lazare station in Paris.

325
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:45,660
Montparnasse station has two sides. One side for suburban trains and one side for long-distance trains.

326
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,240
The suburbs of Paris are the area around Paris, near Paris.

327
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,180
Suburban trains don't go very far

328
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,640
And long-distance trains go far

329
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,420
Mireille arranges to meet Robert at Montparnasse station

330
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,720
But Robert doesn't know how to get to Montparnasse station

331
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,840
Robert is a bit dim-witted.

332
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,160
Because it's not difficult

333
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,100
There is no problem

334
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,740
All you have to do is take the subway

335
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,660
It's easy, you just have to take the subway

336
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:22,840
Yes, Robert, you can just take the subway. It's an easy solution. There's always an easy solution. Look.

337
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,540
I'm bored.

338
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,060
Well, you just have to read it.

339
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,520
Oh, I think I'm going to be sick.

340
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,960
You just have to stop.

341
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,180
I'm sleepy

342
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,100
As for me, you just have to go to bed.

343
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,000
How to get to Montparnasse station?

344
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,500
But it's very easy, you just have to take the subway

345
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,540
Now listen, then imitate Mireille

346
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,680
How do we get to Montparnasse station?

347
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,500
It's easy, you just have to take the subway

348
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,680
Okay, your turn now.

349
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,640
How do we get to Montparnasse station?

350
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,440
It's easy, you just have to take the subway

351
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,840
Well, that's easy, you just have to take the subway.

352
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,980
Well, that's easy, you just have to take the subway.

353
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,600
Mireille explains to Robert how to get to Montparnasse station by metro.

354
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,920
First, you have to go to the station, to Déon, to Saint-Michel.

355
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,180
This is Saint-Michel station.

356
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,080
This is the station at Déon.

357
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,300
A subway station.

358
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,400
Then you have to buy tickets

359
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,880
A book of tickets is cheaper

360
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,060
A notebook, please.

361
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,880
How much is it?

362
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,220
Then you need to look for the line Porte de Clignancourt, Porte d'Orléans

363
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,900
Montparnasse, welcome, is on the Porte de Clignancourt, Porte d'Orléans line

364
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,440
Saint-Michel and Odeon too

365
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,920
So it's direct, there's no change

366
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,780
But if you want to go from Strasbourg-Saint-Denis

367
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,620
at Louis-Blanc, well, that's not direct.

368
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,260
There has been a change.

369
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,220
You need to change trains at Gare de l'Est.

370
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,340
First, you have to go through the gates.

371
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,060
You have to put the ticket in the slot.

372
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,920
You need to take the ticket back.

373
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,280
And we need to find the line

374
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,560
Porte de Clignancourt-Porte d'Orléans.

375
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,380
We must not take the direction

376
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,820
Clignancourt Gate. No, no, no, no.

377
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,240
You need to take the train that comes from there.

378
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,120
and which goes to Porte d'Orléans, that is to say the direction of Porte d'Orléans.

379
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:46,360
There are corridors, tunnels, a whole network of tunnels, a network, the road network, the rail network, the air network.

380
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,980
Robert will get lost in this network of corridors.

381
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,500
He will demonstrate how easily he gets lost.

382
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,220
He will prove that he can get lost anywhere.

383
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,360
Look at Robert on the subway

384
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,880
Robert, the man who gets lost everywhere

385
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,520
Facing him were four gates, two corridors, and one hundred kilometers of tunnels.

386
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,940
The world's largest underground network

387
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:15,520
Once again, Robert will demonstrate his exceptional knack for getting lost.

388
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,700
Robert, the man who gets lost everywhere, almost everywhere

389
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,120
And now, to relax, watch this advertisement for a watch.

390
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:55,100
"On the rails, a Kelton, the watch that can withstand anything. Facing it, four locomotives, 200 wagons weighing 100 tons each, a 2.6 km train, the longest train in the world. Once again, Kelton will prove its exceptional robustness. Kelton, watches that can withstand anything. Well, almost anything."

391
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:02,600
A ticket window at Montreal station, a metro ticket window, a ticket window, a station ticket window.

392
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:16,840
Robert buys a ticket, a train ticket, a subway ticket, a banknote, a plane ticket, a train ticket.

393
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,480
He buys a round-trip ticket.

394
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,580
Paris-Chartres, that's the outbound journey.

395
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,100
Chartres-Paris, it's the return journey.

396
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,540
Paris-Chartres-Paris, it's a round trip.

397
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,280
I would like a ticket to Toronto.

398
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:30,860
Toronto.

399
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
A round trip?

400
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,640
No, go ahead.

401
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,320
Robert buys a second-class return ticket,

402
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,440
because there are two classes.

403
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,860
The second and the first,

404
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,100
which is more comfortable and more expensive.

405
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,240
They validate their tickets.

406
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,100
He boards the train, which departs immediately.

407
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,920
When the train passes through Versailles, Robert says he would like to visit the castle with Mireille.

408
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,560
But Mireille said nothing. She remained lost in her thoughts.

409
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,860
Robert gets lost on the subway and Mireille gets lost in her thoughts.

410
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,780
She's thinking. Or she's dreaming.

411
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:26,700
"Annick, what's wrong with you? Are you dreaming?"

412
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,460
"Oh, by the way, my parents would love to meet you."

413
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,520
"By the way, she's thinking about something else."

414
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,500
"By the way, observe."

415
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,560
"Oh, by the way, I almost forgot."

416
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,840
" It's good. "

417
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,700
Now listen, watch, think, and respond.

418
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,740
Look at Robert here.

419
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,720
Ah, no, sir. No, Mrs. Courtois, it's not here.

420
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,060
What did Robert do?

421
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
He went through the wrong door.

422
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,260
Now, how can we get to Chartres?

423
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,140
We can go there...

424
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,160
by car?

425
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,700
By plane?

426
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,220
By coach?

427
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,920
By train?

428
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,320
By boat?

429
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,100
Oh no, no, not by boat.

430
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,060
By helicopter?

431
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,120
No, not really.

432
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:24,060
By bicycle, by motorcycle, on foot, on skis, when there is snow.

433
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,820
Where do I need to go to catch the train?

434
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,280
We need to go to... the train station.

435
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,740
What happened to Mireille?

436
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,780
It broke down.

437
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,340
Mr. Guignol, I've broken down.

438
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,580
Oh, it's not a problem, I'd already fixed it, there you go, it's sorted.

439
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,420
Oh, thank you, Mr. Guignol

440
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,520
You're welcome, it's nothing, it's the least I could do.

441
