2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We need to watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you will be able to say a few words in French yourself.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The train arrives in Chartres on time.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Robert and Mireille eat and visit the cathedral together.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Robert is amazed by the beauty of the place and his companion.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But when she goes to visit a museum,

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He imagines that he has been killed.

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,060
Oh, are you hungry?

12
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,760
We're going to grab a quick bite at a cafe across the street.

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,220
Look, over there.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:14,760
Hello Mrs.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,260
Good morning.

16
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,080
Hello Mrs.

17
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,960
I would just have a plate of raw vegetables.

18
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Yes.

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,580
For me, a plate of cold cuts, please.

20
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,920
and a small pitcher of wine.

21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,040
Rouge.

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,760
THANKS.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,100
And a carafe of water, please.

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Yes, miss, right away.

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,180
That's nice.

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,840
Yes.

27
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,300
I love sheep too much.

28
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,820
I care about you.

29
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,340
The crudité platter.

30
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,500
The charcuterie platter.

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
The pitcher of red wine.

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,300
There you go, enjoy your meal.

33
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,200
A carafe of water, please.

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,940
Yes, miss.

35
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,220
Do you want some wine?

36
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,680
no thank you

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,040
I'm going to drink by myself

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,120
There

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,880
THANKS

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:22,200
Is your museum near the cathedral?

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,760
right next

42
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,540
Where did you take a taxi?

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,560
You're kidding, it's very close

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,580
we'll walk there

45
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,100
It's ten minutes at most.

46
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,060
As they were about to cross the Charbonniers promenade, they witnessed an accident.

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:46,000
A moped that comes out of a side street too fast hits a van which, fortunately, is traveling very slowly.

48
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:54,000
The cyclist is thrown over the hood onto the opposite sidewalk, right in front of a pharmacy.

49
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,940
It's nothing.

50
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,500
You didn't hurt yourself?

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,180
No, no, it's fine.

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Well, I've landed in a good position.

53
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,180
It's fine, for sure.

54
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,240
Okay, thank you.

55
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:41,880
It's very beautiful.

56
00:04:41,880 --> 00:05:00,060
Robert and Mireille are now in front of the cathedral

57
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,300
They admire the gates

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,700
There you have all the apostles.

59
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,260
They have beautiful faces.

60
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,700
That's Christ.

61
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:20,760
You see, with your feet planted there on the lions, you saw all those monsters.

62
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,660
Yes, this is hell, this side is hell, and on the other side is paradise.

63
00:05:41,700 --> 00:06:11,680
MFP subtitles.

64
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:36,860
Shall we go inside the cathedral?

65
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,260
Aren't you going to the museum?

66
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,480
Yes, in a little while. I have time, it's not even two o'clock yet.

67
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:51,940
There are very few people in the cathedral.

68
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,460
Someone is playing the organ on the bin.

69
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,640
The light that passes through the stained-glass windows of the rose window

70
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,540
projects multicolored stains onto the slabs and the enormous pillars.

71
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,240
A ray of light illuminates Mireille's blond hair for a moment.

72
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Robert is very moved.

73
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:56,400
Okay, I'm going to go.

74
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,060
Let's see, it's 2 o'clock, I'll meet you here in 1 hour, at 3 o'clock sharp.

75
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:01,940
All right ?

76
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,300
All right.

77
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:02,940
See you later.

78
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:13,780
Robert admires the royal portal, the column statues of kings and queens with their long hair.

79
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,300
Then he goes to look at the shops that sell postcards, brassware, guides, lace, all sorts of trinkets.

80
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,440
He wonders if he could buy a small gift for Mireille, but he doesn't dare.

81
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Just at that moment, Robert thought he saw Mireille coming out of the museum.

82
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,940
She is standing very close to a very handsome young blond man who looks Swedish.

83
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,940
She immediately notices his athletic figure and muscular legs.

84
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,940
He is wearing extremely short blue shorts.

85
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,940
She finds his face pleasant and smiles at him.

86
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,940
He smiles back at her and they disappear behind the pool.

87
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:14,220
A few moments later, Mireille arrives like a flower in front of the royal gate.

88
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,100
You see, I'm punctual, it's like trains.

89
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,720
I'm even early, it's only 2:59.

90
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,580
At that moment, Robert notices the handsome Swede who starts up noisily in a red Alpine.

91
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,440
Let's see where we stand.

92
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,840
First, the issue of punctuality.

93
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,380
There are three possibilities.

94
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,880
Early, on time, late.

95
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,420
Your appointment is at 7 o'clock.

96
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,200
You arrive at 7:50.

97
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,000
You are ahead of schedule.

98
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,840
You arrive at 7 o'clock.

99
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,380
You are on time.

100
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,000
You arrive at 7:15.

101
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,860
You are late.

102
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,160
Look at Mireille, she's in a hurry because she's going to be late

103
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,760
Manuel, we're going to be late, we're leaving in 5 minutes, hurry!

104
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,360
Look at Robert, he's late!

105
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Listen, is this person on time?

106
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,400
Excuse me, I'm late, I had an appointment so I couldn't do otherwise

107
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,180
No, it's not a problem.

108
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,880
So, do you have the time? If you tell me it's 2 a.m., then I'm late.

109
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
Well, you're late, sir.

110
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,980
Here, Mireille is not late. She is even early.

111
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm even early, it's only 2:59.

112
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,260
Look at Robert here. He's ahead.

113
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,440
He had a date with Mireille at 10 a.m. He arrives at 10:50. He is early.

114
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,640
In France, trains are punctual. They leave exactly on time.

115
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,360
They leave on time and arrive exactly on time.

116
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,920
The trains are as precise as a clock.

117
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,420
If you know the train schedules, you don't need watches.

118
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,080
You don't need watches to cook soft-boiled eggs.

119
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,260
Look, check out this SNCF advertisement.

120
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,260
Germaine, it's 824, put in the eggs.

121
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,840
Hermann, it's 413. You can remove them.

122
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,160
The train, to be exact.

123
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,720
Obviously, it's an advertisement.

124
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,520
But let's ask this person what they think about it.

125
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,800
Are the trains generally punctual?

126
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,820
They are very punctual.

127
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,420
Do they always arrive on time?

128
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,080
Always on time.

129
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,860
And do they always leave on time?

130
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,140
And they always leave on time, yes.

131
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Now, listen carefully to this exchange between Mireille Robert.

132
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,280
Listen carefully to what Mireille says.

133
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,600
Next, answer Robert as if you were Mireille.

134
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,640
Well, look at that, the train arrived right on time!

135
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,700
Well, obviously, trains are always on time in France.

136
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,160
They are very punctual. They leave exactly on time, they arrive exactly on time.

137
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,480
Always ?

138
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,080
Well, yes, always. Or almost always.

139
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,680
Now it's your turn. Answer in place of Mireille.

140
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,840
Well, look at that, the train arrived right on time!

141
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,360
Well, obviously, trains are always on time in France.

142
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,080
Well, obviously, trains are always on time in France.

143
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,540
Obviously, trains are always on time in France.

144
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,200
Always ?

145
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,960
Yes, always. Well, almost always.

146
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,300
Yes, always. Well, almost always.

147
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,980
Yes, always. Well, almost always.

148
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,160
Next, it's time to eat.

149
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,220
Again ?

150
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,640
This is very important.

151
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,960
Mireille and Robert are going to have lunch quickly

152
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,260
Okay, let's go grab a quick bite at a café across the street.

153
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,980
Mireille takes a plate of raw vegetables

154
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,420
It's very diet-friendly

155
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:12,980
A plate of raw vegetables is essentially vegetables, salad, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots

156
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,980
Tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots

157
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,440
Carrots. Raw carrots, uncooked, raw, like the cutlet, remember?

158
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,260
Robert orders a plate of charcuterie. It's less diet-friendly.

159
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:37,100
Essentially ham, pâté, sausage, charcuterie, anything made with pork.

160
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,340
Robert asks for a pitcher of red wine.

161
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,860
And a small pitcher of wine.

162
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,660
Yes, sir.

163
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,780
He got it right away.

164
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,160
The pitcher of red pasta.

165
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,280
Mireille asks for a carafe of water.

166
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,500
And a carafe of water, please.

167
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,080
That's harder to get.

168
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,520
And a carafe of water, please.

169
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:08,480
A pitcher, a carafe, a carafe of wine, a bottle, a half-bottle.

170
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,880
Observe.

171
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:22,360
A plate of raw vegetables, a plate of cold cuts, a pitcher of wine, a carafe of water, a bottle of Muscadet, a dozen oysters.

172
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:32,400
A plate of raw vegetables, a plate of cold cuts, a pitcher of wine, a carafe of water, a bottle of Muscadet, a dozen oysters.

173
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,300
Next, Robert and Mireille walk to the cathedral.

174
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,760
They walk there because it's not far. It's 10 minutes at most.

175
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,260
Is it 10 minutes at most?

176
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,000
At most, at the maximum. No more than 10 minutes. Maybe less.

177
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,660
Observe what Robert says here.

178
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,080
How old do you think I am?

179
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,240
7-8 years old. At most.

180
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,900
No, I'm 10 years old.

181
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,460
Then we had an accident.

182
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,960
Robert and Mireille witness an accident.

183
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,360
They witness an accident.

184
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,060
These are people attending a ceremony.

185
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,600
Robert and Mireille witness an accident.

186
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:30,220
This includes a motorized bicycle, a small motorcycle, a moped, a Solex bicycle, a motorized bicycle and a van, a small truck.

187
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,340
The motorized bicycle hits the van.

188
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:51,760
The cyclist was thrown over the hood of the van. The hood. The mechanic lifted the hood of the car. Luckily, the van wasn't going very fast.

189
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,400
Here, the car is not moving, it is stopped.

190
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,280
Here, she rolls

191
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,160
Driving too fast is dangerous, look

192
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,700
Fortunately, the cyclist was not injured.

193
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,160
You didn't hurt yourself?

194
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,580
He didn't hurt himself

195
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,440
Look at Marie-Laure here, she's going to hurt herself

196
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,320
Ouch!

197
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,240
Yes, yes, yes

198
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,760
Did you hurt yourself?

199
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,620
Uh, a little

200
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,980
She hurt herself, she's in pain

201
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,360
He hurt himself

202
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,600
Look at Marie-Laure here

203
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,160
She's in pain all over

204
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:39,980
Look at this child, he's in pain.

205
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:49,520
The cyclist fell on the sidewalk

206
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,560
The sidewalk

207
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,280
In the street.

208
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,380
Look closely here.

209
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,160
Are the passers-by on the sidewalk or in the street?

210
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,900
In the street.

211
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,980
And here they are on the sidewalk.

212
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,160
The cyclist fell badly.

213
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,940
He fell right in front of a pharmacy.

214
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,900
A pharmacy where medicines are sold.

215
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:25,120
Now we are going to visit the cathedral with Mireille and Robert. Mireille has to go.

216
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,960
to the museum, but she's not going right away, she'll go later. You're not going...

217
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,640
I'll go to the museum later too, I have time, it's not even two o'clock yet, not right now

218
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:46,140
Go do your homework later, not later, now.

219
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:53,640
I'm leaving right away, tomorrow actually, Mireille will go to the museum later for

220
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:02,940
At that moment she was walking around the cathedral with Robert; he was admiring the facade, the towers, the apse...

221
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Flying buttresses, sculptures, portals – there are two types of portals

222
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:16,380
That's a portal, for example. That's also a portal. These are portals of

223
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,840
private houses like this one too, I'll accompany you because no, continue, I can

224
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,560
opening a gate all by yourself, that's one kind of gate, and then there are the

225
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:36,900
Church and cathedral portals, here is a Romanesque church portal, the portal of the

226
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:45,560
Reims Cathedral, the west portal of Chartres, the south portal, you have all the apostles, they have

227
00:18:45,560 --> 00:19:02,160
Beautiful heads there, that's Christ you see, with his feet placed there on lions, I saw them all

228
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:11,220
These monsters, yes, that's hell, this side is hell and the other side is paradise.

229
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:19,180
They admire the rose windows, the west rose window seen from the outside, the rose window seen from the inside.

230
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,900
That is the west rose window of Notre-Dame de Paris.

231
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,920
And then, they admire the stained glass windows, a stained glass window, stained glass windows.

232
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,720
Light, rays of light, pass through the stained glass windows.

233
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,940
It leaves colored stains on the pillars and Mireille's hair.

234
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Robert is very moved.

235
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,280
Her heart is beating, it's making a knocking, knocking, knocking sound.

236
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,120
It's religious emotion.

237
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,620
She is moved because her son brings her a gift.

238
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,740
He is moved.

239
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,460
Now, Mireille is going to the museum.

240
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,940
She arranges to meet Robert in an hour.

241
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,760
It is two o'clock, she will meet Robert in one hour, that is to say at three o'clock.

242
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,720
Okay, I'm going to go. Let's see, it's two o'clock, I'll meet you here in an hour, at three o'clock sharp. Okay?

243
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,060
All right.

244
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,900
I'm going. See you later.

245
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,260
See you later.

246
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,300
See you later, my little one.

247
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,240
See you later.

248
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,160
See you later.

249
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:33,380
And Mireille leaves. Robert looks at the queens of the gate with their long hair, blond, obviously.

250
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:52,020
Then he looks at the shops around the cathedral. He sees all sorts of little trinkets, small objects, souvenirs. There are jewels, copperware, copper objects, pottery.

251
00:20:52,020 --> 00:21:04,360
Here are pottery pieces, pots, terracotta objects, postcards, clothes, skirts, dresses, here are some clothes.

252
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,300
There is lace.

253
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,520
He thinks about buying something for Mireille, but he doesn't dare.

254
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,200
Look at Robert here.

255
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,600
He wonders if he should take Mireille's hand, but he doesn't dare.

256
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,220
It's the verb "to dare".

257
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,480
Observe this scene from a crime film.

258
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,240
Let's see if you recognize the verb "to dare".

259
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,880
Ah, you could have told me sooner.

260
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,560
SO ?

261
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,660
I didn't dare, I was afraid of compromising myself.

262
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,220
While Robert looks at the shop windows,

263
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,000
Something strange is happening.

264
00:21:45,520 --> 00:22:00,720
And Robert thinks he sees Mireille coming out of the museum. He thinks he sees her. He's not sure, it's not clear. Maybe it's not her, maybe it's someone else, or maybe it's an illusion.

265
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,980
He thinks he sees Mireille heading towards the garden behind the cathedral.

266
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,780
She is heading in the direction of the garden.

267
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,780
He believes he sees her approaching a young man with muscular legs.

268
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,460
Muscular. Now that's a muscular man.

269
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,200
He may not be very intelligent, but he has a lot of muscles.

270
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:32,160
"Robert thinks he sees Mireille disappear with the young man behind the apse of the cathedral."

271
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,580
The apse. This is the apse of Chartres Cathedral.

272
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,500
The apse of Notre-Dame de Paris.

273
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,120
A Gothic apse.

274
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,640
This is a Romanesque apse.

275
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,280
"Mireille and the young man disappear."

276
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,060
We can't see them anymore.

277
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,960
It's the verb "to disappear".

278
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,840
Look, Mireille is here. Now she's gone. She's disappeared. Poof, she's gone.

279
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:08,500
Ah, the sauerkraut is gone. And look here, there were clouds and now there are no more clouds. The clouds have disappeared.

280
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,100
Let's see if you recognize the verb "disappear" in this scene from a crime film.

281
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:21,700
Before boarding the plane, the man abandoned it for a few moments, I suppose to call an accomplice.

282
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,380
and tell him that everything went well.

283
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,680
When he hung up, the kid had disappeared.

284
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,280
The child had disappeared. He was no longer there.

285
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,900
This whole story is not very clear.

286
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,940
Has Robert seen Mireille?

287
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,540
Was it her?

288
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,320
Or did he imagine it was her?

289
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,420
I don't know about that.

290
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,820
Is Robert jealous?

291
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,840
In any case, a few moments later,

292
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,460
Mireille arrives like a flower

293
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,940
She arrives just like that, like a flower

294
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,760
At ease, natural, uncomplicated, smiling

295
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,300
Everything's fine, everything's fine, yes

296
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,800
But Robert notices the young man

297
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,720
Which starts off noisily in a magnificent red alpine

298
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,660
It starts with a lot of noise

299
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,620
It's the verb to start, he starts

300
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,180
Start.

301
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,660
Okay, so, here we go.

302
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,220
So, do you like Chartres? It's interesting, isn't it?

303
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,420
Of course, that's interesting.

304
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,760
Okay, well, now let's see if you remember anything.

305
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,360
Listen, think, and speak.

306
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Look at this train. Do you think it's leaving late, early, or on time?

307
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,420
On time.

308
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,040
Marie-Laure is leaving. She'll be back in a little while.

309
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,800
What do you tell him?

310
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,640
See you later, my little one.

311
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,560
See you later.

312
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,100
Look closely. What is it?

313
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,360
A plate of raw vegetables or a plate of cold cuts?

314
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,180
A plate of raw vegetables.

315
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,940
Is this a plate of raw vegetables or a plate of cold cuts?

316
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,340
