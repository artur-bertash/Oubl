2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,020
Pretty soon you will figure out what's going on

4
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,300
and be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,500
Returning to Paris, Robert and Mireille get seats on a crowded train,

6
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,240
unaware that they are sharing the compartment with a mysterious man in black.

7
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,840
Tonight, Mireille must visit a friend in Saint-Germain.

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,340
Tomorrow, one in Provence.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Robert, ever jealous, spends hours trying to find her.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:55,760
On the train back from Chartres, Robert is not in a very good mood.

12
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,400
There are a lot of people on your train. Look at that.

13
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,480
All the compartments are crowded.

14
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,580
No, that's not true.

15
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,900
All the seats are taken, look at that.

16
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,140
People are packed in like sardines.

17
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,920
If I had known, I would have stayed home.

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,580
Or I would have rented a car.

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,680
Yeah, or you would have come on foot.

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,480
Don't worry.

21
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,820
We're not going to stand in the corridor.

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,080
Let's look further.

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,640
We'll find a place.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
Hey, what did I tell you?

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,800
This compartment is empty.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,500
Finally, almost empty.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,940
In one corner, there is a passenger hiding behind a newspaper.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,580
The man in black. Strange.

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,520
I really don't understand how you can prefer the train to the car.

30
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,260
I appreciate the SNCF.

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:53,980
What?

32
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,840
SNCF, the French National Railway Company.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,240
Note, I have nothing against the car.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,380
On the contrary, I would love to have a small, convertible car.

35
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,880
Or at least with a sunroof.

36
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,060
And a large trunk to put my suitcases in with all my dresses inside.

37
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,140
And a mini-bike.

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,160
A small Peugeot 205.

39
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,960
You wouldn't have preferred a little Alpine Renault, by any chance?

40
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,300
Yes, that's true, of course.

41
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,140
Now that's a car.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,760
The real sports car.

43
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,480
Nervous, fast.

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
Lightning-fast comebacks.

45
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,860
And as for road handling, it's fantastic.

46
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,580
It's driven with the little finger.

47
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
And it works, you can do 140 km/h all day without overheating.

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,240
And the braking was impeccable.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,640
4 power-assisted disc brakes.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,160
And it uses almost no energy.

51
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,860
6.5 litres per 100 km.

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,140
Hey, you seem to know your stuff.

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,980
Not necessarily, it's something you're born with.

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,400
My father works at Renault.

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,160
But anyway, all of that is not for me.

56
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,660
Note that in a way, I just as much like hitchhiking.

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,340
All the advantages of a car without the disadvantages.

58
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,340
Are you hitchhiking?

59
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,160
It happened to me.

60
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,420
Once, I hitchhiked from Paris to Geneva.

61
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,440
It took me 8 hours.

62
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,660
That's not bad.

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,020
But isn't that dangerous?

64
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,140
Aren't you afraid?

65
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,420
Non.

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,340
And that's the charm.

67
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:30,380
That's it, we've arrived.

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
Mireille and Robert get off the train

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,940
and exit Montparnasse station.

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,520
If we were to have dinner on a riverboat,

71
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,260
That would be great, I'll invite you.

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,380
That could be good, right?

73
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,560
With all the monuments illuminated.

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,300
Oh, do you think so?

75
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,860
That's something for American tourists.

76
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,920
You're not an American tourist, are you?

77
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,760
Anyway, I'm not free tonight.

78
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,760
I have to go to a friend's house to see Saint-Germain.

79
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,000
And the bus is this way.

80
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,240
What? Your driver isn't waiting for you with the Alpine?

81
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,500
My driver? Oh no, not tonight. I gave him the night off.

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,740
Look, here comes my bus. Well, on a Thursday evening.

83
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Don't forget that you should be home around 7:30 or 8:00.

84
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Won't I be able to see you tomorrow?

85
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,740
No, impossible. Tomorrow I'm going to Provence. Goodbye.

86
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Hello.

87
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,740
And the bus starts.

88
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,840
A friend?

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,400
It wouldn't surprise me if this friend had a slight Swedish look about her.

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,780
and beautiful, muscular legs in a pair of sky-blue shorts.

91
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,180
Is Robert jealous?

92
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,740
Taxi !

93
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,860
He hails a taxi.

94
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,360
Boulevard Saint-Germain, please. Where can I stop you? I don't know.

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,700
Not mine either, at Flore's café, yes, that's it.

96
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:54,140
No Mireille, nor any Swedes, at the Flore.

97
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,580
Neither at Demago's, nor at his home, nor at the drugstore, nor at the Martinican romance shop.

98
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,900
Not at Vagenand, nor at Proca, nor at Tabou, nor at Riverside, nor at Whisky à Gogo.

99
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Where could she be?

100
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,200
Where could she be?

101
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,480
I don't know about that.

102
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,360
Robert and Mireille leave Chartres and its cathedral.

103
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,580
They went to the train station to take the train to Paris.

104
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:51,120
They just boarded the train. They're looking for seats. They look in all the compartments, but there are no seats available. There are lots of empty seats. All the compartments are packed. The train is crowded. There are no seats available. All the seats are taken.

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,560
Here too, the train is crowded.

106
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,120
All places are taken.

107
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,980
But not here.

108
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,620
There are some free seats here.

109
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
There are also free seats here.

110
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,160
There are some free seats here.

111
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,600
There are two free seats there, but the third one is taken.

112
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,300
This carriage has a corridor and compartments.

113
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,700
A compartment.

114
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,860
A compartment.

115
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,820
The corridor.

116
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,400
The corridor. A corridor at university. A corridor on the subway.

117
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,940
Here, Robert and Mireille are standing in the corridor.

118
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,120
Here, they are sitting in a compartment.

119
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,740
Where are the gentleman and lady? In the corridor or in the compartment?

120
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,580
In the compartment.

121
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,180
And the conductor, is he in the compartment or in the corridor?

122
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,280
In the corridor.

123
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,900
Robert is not happy because there are too many people

124
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,080
No, that's not true, all the seats are taken

125
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,060
No, that's not true, he's not happy

126
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,420
Look at Mireille here, she's not happy either.

127
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,440
Oh no, that's not true.

128
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,400
No, that's not true, all the seats are taken

129
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,060
Look at this, people are packed in like sardines!

130
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,880
The train is crowded, people are packed in tightly.

131
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,180
They are packed in like sardines.

132
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,660
Robert is not happy.

133
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,980
He grumbles.

134
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,080
He regrets coming.

135
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,000
If I had known, I would have stayed home.

136
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,460
If I had known...

137
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,780
Look at Marie-Laure here.

138
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,880
She's not happy either.

139
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,880
She is outraged.

140
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,900
She regrets having worked so hard.

141
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,100
If she had known, she would have watched television instead of working.

142
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,720
There is no justice.

143
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,600
If I had known, I would have watched TV.

144
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,220
It took me an hour to do this assignment. It's outrageous.

145
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,860
Mireille is optimistic.

146
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,260
We'll find a place.

147
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,380
Hey, what did I tell you?

148
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,940
Mireille is always right.

149
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,320
This compartment is empty.

150
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,820
Look, Marie-Laure never makes a mistake either.

151
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,200
That's a ten of diamonds.

152
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,920
What was I saying? I'm never wrong.

153
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,640
This compartment is almost never empty, well, almost never, this compartment is alive

154
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:30,660
The room is empty, well, almost empty. This glass is full, this one is...

155
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:39,120
The box of chocolates is empty, well, almost empty, the plate is empty.

156
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
The carriage is empty.

157
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,680
Mireille appreciates the SNCF, the French National Railway Company.

158
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,220
Everyone appreciates the SNCF.

159
00:10:50,220 --> 00:11:04,420
Because trains are

160
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,160
dressers

161
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,220
comfortable

162
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,020
We are pleased

163
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,780
to inform you that a bar

164
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,960
Relaxation is available to you throughout the entire course. You will find an assortment there.

165
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,100
cold plates, croque-monsieur, sandwiches, coffee and drinks.

166
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,880
And most importantly, the trains are punctual. And besides, the trains are fast.

167
00:11:49,780 --> 00:12:19,760
MFP subtitles.

168
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:49,760
Subtitles ST' 501

169
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:56,540
She takes the train. But she would love to have a car. If she were rich, she would like

170
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:03,580
It's good to have a car. But is Mireille rich? No, she isn't. If

171
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,820
She was rich, that's an assumption. An assumption contrary to reality.

172
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:28,040
If she were rich, let's say, she would like to have a car. "If she were rich" is the imperfect tense. "She would like to have a car," she would like, is the conditional tense.

173
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,680
She would like to have a convertible car

174
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,360
Or a car with a sunroof

175
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,740
The 2CV, for example, has a sunroof.

176
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,700
A sunroof

177
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
A sunroof

178
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,340
She would like a large trunk to put her luggage in.

179
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,120
The trunk is full

180
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,220
You can put a lot of things in a chest

181
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,700
Mireille would like a large trunk to put her suitcases in.

182
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,520
There you go, suitcases.

183
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,240
A suitcase, a suitcase

184
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,200
Look at this gentleman and this lady.

185
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,700
They have two children and a suitcase

186
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,140
Suitcases are interesting.

187
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,700
Mireille would love to have an Alpine.

188
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,480
Because that's a car.

189
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,200
Now that's a car!

190
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,200
Now that's a car!

191
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,380
It's a fast, responsive car with lightning-fast acceleration.

192
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,080
It accelerates quickly.

193
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,740
Lightning-fast comebacks, like a bolt from the blue.

194
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,880
That's a stunning look.

195
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,440
And as for road handling, it's fantastic.

196
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,120
It's a car that handles well on the road.

197
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,980
A car that handles well.

198
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,660
The car handles surprisingly well.

199
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,980
This is a small car that handles the road very well.

200
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,820
That one also holds up well.

201
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,460
It's holding up well.

202
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
It's an easy car to drive.

203
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,900
It's driven with the little finger.

204
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,980
And we can do 140.

205
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,180
140 km/h, all day long, without heating.

206
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,140
That's a car that's overheating.

207
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,760
But the Alpine doesn't overheat.

208
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,300
And the braking was impeccable.

209
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,480
It brakes well.

210
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,900
It's a car with good brakes.

211
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,740
Here's the brake pedal.

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,580
And there's the handbrake.

213
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,720
Bob has the opportunity to test the brakes thoroughly during a fast drive through a city.

214
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,600
These are mixed brakes, disc at the front, drum at the rear.

215
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
For the brakes, this is the real test.

216
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,080
A brake, to brake, braking.

217
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,740
And it doesn't use that much fuel.

218
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,260
It doesn't use much gas.

219
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,720
Look, a motorized bicycle.

220
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,740
Does it consume a lot? No!

221
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,620
It uses very little fuel.

222
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,820
And Robert and Mireille are drinking kir.

223
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,260
The Alpine doesn't consume much fuel.

224
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,360
Approximately 7 litres per 100 km.

225
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,980
7 litres to travel 100 km

226
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,880
The R5 consumes even less

227
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,200
And as for braking, impeccable.

228
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,660
4 power-assisted disc brakes

229
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,220
Mireille seems to know a lot about cars

230
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,080
She seems to know what she's talking about.

231
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,280
Hey, you seem to know your stuff.

232
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,740
He knows his wine.

233
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,020
In our family, everyone loves the smell of lavender soup.

234
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,320
And we know a thing or two about lavender here.

235
00:16:49,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Mireille is a car expert, she knows her stuff, not necessarily, it's from birth, it's from birth, since her father is an engineer at Renault.

236
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:12,980
She was born that way, Mireille doesn't have a car, it's a shame, she would like to, but in a way, she likes hitchhiking just as much.

237
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,620
Here are Robert and Mireille hitchhiking

238
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,340
Here's someone hitchhiking

239
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,480
Here's the cartoonist Serre hitchhiking.

240
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,400
He also hitchhikes

241
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,760
And what are they doing? Are they hitchhiking?

242
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,660
No, they're hitchhiking by boat

243
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,480
Hitchhiking is great.

244
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,180
It has all the advantages of a car, without the disadvantages

245
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,060
The car has advantages

246
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,760
It's fast, that's an advantage.

247
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:55,320
It's convenient. That's an advantage too. But it uses gas. That's a disadvantage. It breaks down. That's a disadvantage too.

248
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:08,540
Do you hitchhike? Yes, I have. It happens to her. She has hitchhiked. She has hitchhiked a few times. Not often, but it has happened to her.

249
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,280
Observe what Marie-Laure says

250
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,380
Are you doing well in school?

251
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,580
Did you get 10 out of 10 on your homework?

252
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,440
It happened to me once

253
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,620
And you sometimes get zero?

254
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,680
It happened to me

255
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,940
Once, Mireille hitchhiked from Paris to Geneva

256
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,560
It took her 8 hours

257
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,700
She left at 1 a.m. and arrived at 9 a.m.

258
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,940
So it took her 8 hours

259
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:42,820
Now listen carefully to this exchange between Mireille and Robert about hitchhiking.

260
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Then you will answer Robert as if you were Mireille.

261
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,560
Are you hitchhiking?

262
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,460
It happened to me

263
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,900
Now answer Robert as if you were Mireille.

264
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,260
Are you hitchhiking?

265
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,160
It happened to me

266
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,840
It happened to me

267
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,360
It happened to me

268
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,600
Now we're going to ask someone if they hitchhike.

269
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,820
Do you hitchhike?

270
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,720
Very rarely.

271
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:11,980
Very rarely.

272
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,620
Has that never happened to you?

273
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,240
Yes, it has happened to me, but rarely.

274
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,620
Is it dangerous to hitchhike?

275
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,760
Yes, we still need to take certain precautions.

276
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,240
Robert suggests to Mireille that they go to dinner on a riverboat.

277
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,080
If we went to dinner on a riverboat, that would be nice, I'll treat you.

278
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,900
That could be good, right?

279
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,220
The Bateaux Mouches are boats that go up and down the Seine.

280
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,480
There are small ones and there are big ones.

281
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,580
On the larger ones, you can have dinner in the evening.

282
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,640
Of course, it's a tourist thing, but it's not bad.

283
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,240
It's one way of seeing a part of Paris.

284
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,580
And in the evening, you can see the illuminated monuments.

285
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,540
That would be great, I'll invite you.

286
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,700
That could be good, right?

287
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,840
With all the monuments illuminated.

288
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,960
That would be good.

289
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,320
Listen to what Marie-Laure says.

290
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,140
If I didn't have this dissertation to finish for tomorrow, we could go to the movies.

291
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,800
Yes, that would be good.

292
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,220
Mireille cannot accept Robert's invitation.

293
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,240
She is not free tonight.

294
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,280
She has to go to a friend's house who lives on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

295
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,140
She's going to take the bus from here to get there.

296
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
Anyway, I'm not free tonight.

297
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,860
I have to go to a friend's house on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

298
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:38,680
She checks the bus number and route. Robert thinks of the Alpine and

299
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,320
to the young man with a Swedish look who saw him in Chartres and he said very

300
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,500
(Sarcastic) You're going to take the bus? What do you mean your driver isn't waiting for you?

301
00:20:50,500 --> 00:21:01,180
Not with the Alpine, he really seems jealous, this Robert, a driver, a taxi driver, mind you.

302
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:07,640
Mireille doesn't understand this sarcastic allusion to the fact that the driver is a woman.

303
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,000
Robert, my driver, oh no, not tonight, I gave him the night off. Tonight I gave my

304
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,400
I told the driver, James, I don't need you tonight, you can take the evening off.

305
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Mireille leaves and Robert, left alone on the sidewalk, becomes increasingly suspicious.

306
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,940
A friend? I wouldn't be surprised if this friend had a slightly Swedish look and nice muscular legs in a little sky-blue shorts.

307
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,560
That wouldn't surprise me.

308
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,640
Observe what Marie-Laure says here.

309
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,380
I wouldn't be surprised if they were chocolates.

310
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,860
Exactly, chocolates.

311
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,660
I had guessed it.

312
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,460
This little girl is really very intelligent, very perceptive.

313
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,400
A friend?

314
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,200
It wouldn't surprise me if this friend had a bit of a Swedish look and nice muscular legs in a little sky-blue shorts.

315
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,940
What is Robert imagining?

316
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,420
Is Mireille having a meeting with the young man from Chartres on Boulevard Saint-Germain?

317
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,260
In any case, he stops a taxi to go to Boulevard Saint-Germain.

318
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,200
Taxi !

319
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,880
Boulevard Saint-Germain, please.

320
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,480
On Boulevard Saint-Germain, yes, very good, but where?

321
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,920
Where do I stop you?

322
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,620
I don't know.

323
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,980
Me neither.

324
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,980
Boulevard Saint-Germain is vague, it's vast.

325
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Boulevard Saint-Germain is long.

326
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,880
The taxi driver, who is a woman, suggests stopping Robert at the Café de Flore.

327
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,200
At the Café de Flore?

328
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,560
Because it's one of the most famous places in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

329
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:11,180
A literary café where Jean-Paul Sartre used to be seen, very close to the Saint-Germain-des-Prés church.

330
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,440
Robert is looking for Mireille at the Café de Flore, but she's not there.

331
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,040
He is looking for De Mago, another well-known cafe, just opposite the church.

332
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,860
He goes across the street to Brasserie Lippe, another very well-known cafe and restaurant.

333
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,460
He goes next door, to the Drugstore, to the Martinique Romerie.

334
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,380
where they mainly serve punches and rum-based drinks,

335
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,160
Chez Vagenande, a restaurant in the style of 1900

336
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,860
At Le Procope, the oldest café in Paris, dating back to the 17th century

337
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,820
At Tabou, a cellar, a very well-known nightclub

338
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,880
Everywhere, that is, but no Mireille, nowhere.

339
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,380
Where could she be?

340
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,380
Where could she be?

341
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,560
I don't know

342
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,240
Nobody knows

343
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
Let's see what you know

344
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,080
Listen, watch, think, and speak.

345
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,560
Look.

346
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,080
Are all the seats taken or are there any seats available?

347
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,160
There are some free seats.

348
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,080
And here, are there any free seats or are all the seats taken?

349
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,360
All places are taken.

350
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,140
Look at Robert and Mireille.

351
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,220
Are they in the compartment or in the corridor?

352
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,540
In the corridor.

353
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,680
And this gentleman, is he in the compartment or in the corridor?

354
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,120
In the compartment.

355
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:51,580
Based on this image, can you say that this car has lightning-fast acceleration or that it brakes well?

356
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,640
Make sure it brakes properly.

357
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,600
Look at Robert and Mireille here.

358
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,600
What are they doing?

359
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Are they hitchhiking or taking the train?

360
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
They are hitchhiking.

361
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,440
In your opinion, is that a hovercraft or a riverboat?

362
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,600
A riverboat.

363
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,640
You have a car that consumes very little fuel.

364
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,820
Is this a disadvantage or an advantage?

365
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,380
That's an advantage.

366
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,960
You receive a gift and you're almost certain it's chocolates.

367
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,460
What are you saying? You're saying...

368
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,140
I wouldn't be surprised if they were chocolates.

369
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,360
Again.

370
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,540
I wouldn't be surprised if they were chocolates.

371
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,020
You are not happy. You regret coming.

372
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,980
What are you saying? You're saying...

373
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,540
If I had known, I would have stayed home.

374
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,300
Again.

375
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,940
If I had known, I would have stayed home.

376
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,000
Now, your daughter or your little sister is doing something wrong.

377
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,620
She drops the snack tray, for example.

378
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,240
What are you saying?

379
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,000
That's not true!

380
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,240
Once again

381
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,300
That's not true

382
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,580
Once again, you are right.

383
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,000
What are you saying?

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,320
What was I saying? I'm never wrong

385
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,080
Once again

386
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,600
What was I saying? I'm never wrong

387
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,600
I think there's a mouse around here

388
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,020
Haven't you seen a mouse?

389
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,280
What was I saying? Here she is!

390
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,720
What is it, Mr. Guignol?

391
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,980
There's a mouse

392
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,800
But come on, Mr. Guignol, that's not true. Are you afraid of mice?

393
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,260
Yes, then!

394
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,800
But come on, at your age...

395
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,420
Yes, I'm afraid of mice. It's gasoline.

396
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:29,980
