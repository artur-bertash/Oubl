3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,900
On the terrace of Fouquet's, Mireille, Hubert, Robert, Jean-Pierre.

4
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,420
Waiter, the bill, please.

5
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,100
The boy is looking away.

6
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,240
Five minutes later, Hubert signaled to the boy.

7
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,000
So, when is that bill coming?

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No effect.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
After ten minutes, Mireille calls the boy.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Could you bring us the bill, please?

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Right away, miss.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And they head towards another table.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ten minutes later, Robert tries his luck.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Could we have the bill, please?

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, sir. There you go, sir.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That makes one hundred and thirty-five francs.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,700
Robert hands the boy a 200 franc note.

18
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,800
Hubert, Jean-Pierre and Mireille turn away modestly.

19
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,380
The boy places his tray full of glasses on the table to give Robert his change.

20
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,140
When giving change...

21
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,380
So, 135 and 5...

22
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,380
40...

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,780
And ten. There you go.

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,440
He drops a coin.

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,420
Everyone rushes to pick it up.

26
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,840
The tray falls to the ground, the glasses shatter into a thousand pieces.

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,160
That's bad luck, then.

28
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,280
No, on the contrary, it brings good luck, it's white glass.

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,760
Well, all that's left for me to do is take my leave.

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,200
Thank you.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:14,280
Goodbye everyone, Hubert has taken leave. Well, a lime bath then. Bye!

32
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,000
Jean-Pierre has left.

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,500
Robert and Mireille also get up and leave.

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,020
They walk down the Champs-Élysées.

35
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,740
Robert notes that several young couples, and even some older ones, are holding hands.

36
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:47,020
He wonders if he should take Mireille's hand too.

37
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,040
But he doesn't dare

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,020
On the sidewalk, next to a newsstand

39
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,380
He notices a small stall with a sign

40
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,760
National Lottery, draw on Wednesday

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:09,220
Tell me, do we ever win this lottery?

42
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,620
I imagine so, but I've never won anything.

43
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,040
I must say that I have never bought a ticket.

44
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,800
It's not exactly against my principles, but I don't really like it.

45
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,840
It's not particularly in line with my principles either, but I could really use some fresh cash.

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,340
Life seems to be expensive in France.

47
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,020
And then, we have to take advantage of the opportunity with all this broken white glass.

48
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,900
Okay, let's buy a ticket, shall we?

49
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,740
If that amuses you.

50
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,660
In any case, part of the money goes to a good cause.

51
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,660
Tuberculosis patients, nursing homes for the elderly,

52
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Broken wings, shattered faces.

53
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,440
Go ahead, choose.

54
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,360
Oh no, choose yourself.

55
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,240
No, you.

56
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,380
No, not me, I never have any luck.

57
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,020
Yes, yes, you must be very lucky right now.

58
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
You just broke at least 12 white glasses.

59
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,700
I didn't break them, you did.

60
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,200
No, it's not me, it's you.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,540
Actually, no, it's Hubert, I saw him.

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,520
But that doesn't matter. Go ahead.

63
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,760
Take any ticket as long as the last two digits add up to nine.

64
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:19,360
18, 27, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90.

65
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,520
Why is that?

66
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,320
It's obvious. You're 18 years old.

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,640
Almost 19.

68
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,340
Okay. You live at 18, 8 and 1, 9.

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,400
The drinks cost exactly 135 francs.

70
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
3 and 1, 4 and 5, 9.

71
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,600
and I counted nine couples, young or old, holding hands.

72
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Oh, that one!

73
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,000
Mireille chooses a ticket sold to benefit an organization

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,060
who takes care of abandoned babies.

75
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
Because she liked the ticket immediately.

76
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,800
Against the background, he wears the palisade, an adorable pink baby doll

77
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,040
and number 63-728-127, series MR,

78
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,440
That makes a lot of new things, if you look closely.

79
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,540
and recognizable initials.

80
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,740
Robert would like Mireille to keep the ticket.

81
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,700
Here, keep it.

82
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,680
Oh no, I'd be too afraid of losing it.

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,840
Are you losing things?

84
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,200
Not me. You're the one who loses things and loses yourself.

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,960
Not me.

86
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,380
But still, I'd prefer that you keep it.

87
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,140
Don't forget to buy the newspaper on Thursday morning.

88
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,540
to see the list of winners.

89
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,220
Yes, to see how much we've won.

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,660
Jean-Pierre asks for the bill.

91
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,240
Waiter, the bill, please.

92
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,000
But the boy doesn't pay attention to him.

93
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,520
The boy doesn't see him.

94
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,480
He doesn't look at Jean-Pierre.

95
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,940
He's looking elsewhere.

96
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,860
Here, elsewhere.

97
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,420
Hubert tries to get the boy's attention.

98
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,780
No effect.

99
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,740
So, when is this bill coming?

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,720
No effect. Nothing happens.

101
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,080
Press.

102
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,720
No effect.

103
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,880
Now there is an effect.

104
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,880
And there you have it, a punch that has no effect.

105
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,400
Hubert tries to get the boy's attention.

106
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,880
So, when will this bill arrive?

107
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,180
He's trying to catch his train.

108
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,040
The little boy is trying to get his father's attention.

109
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,640
Charlotte's sleep quality has declined.

110
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,040
She's going to try to sleep.

111
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,700
I'll try.

112
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,540
The boy heads towards another table.

113
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,740
He goes to another table.

114
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,920
He heads towards the chair.

115
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,660
They head towards the car.

116
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,480
They head towards the house.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,400
Where are you going?

118
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:12,900
To be.

119
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,760
They head towards the house.

120
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,420
Robert signals to the boy.

121
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,140
He signals for a taxi.

122
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,560
She flags down a taxi.

123
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,600
Signs.

124
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,940
They are waving.

125
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,660
He gestures for her to come over.

126
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,640
He gestures for silence.

127
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,220
They gesture for silence.

128
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,420
He signals that he is going to turn.

129
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,600
Mireille tried to get the bill, but she was unsuccessful.

130
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,180
The boy did not bring the bill.

131
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,180
Please bring us the bill.

132
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,880
Jean-Pierre tried, but he didn't succeed either.

133
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,780
Waiter, the bill, please.

134
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,680
Robert tried his luck.

135
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,060
Could we have the bill, please?

136
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,720
Marie-Laure also tries her luck.

137
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,760
She is looking for the 10 of diamonds, but she doesn't know where it is.

138
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,600
So she takes her chance and she succeeds.

139
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,120
Let's see.

140
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,960
That's the 10 of diamonds.

141
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,620
She takes her chance there and she succeeds.

142
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,520
She's lucky. Jean-Pierre is taking his chance.

143
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,780
Excuse me, miss. Do you have a light, please?

144
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,960
But he did not succeed.

145
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,720
You can try your luck at roulette, or horse racing, or dice.

146
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,720
Robert tries his luck and he succeeds. The boy immediately gives him the bill.

147
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,380
There you go, sir. That'll be 135 francs.

148
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,480
Robert pays. The others turn away discreetly.

149
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,700
They're looking elsewhere.

150
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,440
They turn away.

151
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Jean-Claude, would you please turn away discreetly?

152
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,460
They turn away modestly.

153
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,720
And you, sir, do you wish to turn away discreetly?

154
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
Here is a modest young girl.

155
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,500
Here is a modest young man.

156
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,300
To give Robert his change, the boy puts down his tray.

157
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,060
I take off my glasses.

158
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,500
The man in black placed his glasses on the table.

159
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,720
She placed her hand on the gentleman's.

160
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,360
Here, sir, would you like to place your hand on miss's?

161
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,140
Well, to learn French.

162
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,960
The customs officer places the suitcase on the table

163
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,600
The maid places the tureen on the table

164
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,020
And the boy places the glasses on the table

165
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,120
The boy drops a coin

166
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,800
Everyone rushes to pick it up

167
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,440
Everyone rushes to pick it up

168
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,360
She hurries to catch their train

169
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,020
Look, there's a precipice.

170
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,480
And now Robert rushes headlong into the precipice.

171
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,940
He wants to jump from the sixth floor

172
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,340
The children rush onto the beach

173
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,920
They were thrown into the hole

174
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,140
The water looks good.

175
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,580
They rush into the water

176
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,820
They rush into the water

177
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,340
They rush into the water. They rush into the water.

178
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,400
The phone rings. They rush to answer it.

179
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,960
They rush. But here, nobody rushes.

180
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,940
The phone rings and nobody rushes to answer.

181
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,720
Everyone rushes to pick up the coin.

182
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,560
There, they pick up Mireille's diary.

183
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,620
And they, they collect the toy cars

184
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,760
They pick up the papers

185
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,600
They are collecting papers

186
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,060
Cécile picks up the pieces

187
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,020
She picks up a pen

188
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,320
We shovel up the dead leaves.

189
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,580
And here, a Swiss Mercedes

190
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,000
pick up the two hitchhikers.

191
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,380
The tray falls and the glasses shatter into a thousand pieces.

192
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,680
Here too, the tray falls and the glasses break.

193
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,420
If I break it, I'll only owe you 200 francs?

194
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,620
But why do you want to break it?

195
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,860
To be sure, I want to be certain, you understand, I've already made so many mistakes.

196
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,220
Someone broke a window here.

197
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,000
When the Bélots bought their country house,

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,960
All the windows were broken. One window was broken.

199
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,420
He broke his leg. He broke his leg too.

200
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,460
And he broke both his legs.

201
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,180
He broke two legs. She broke one leg. In total, three broken legs.

202
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,360
What happened? I broke my arm.

203
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,460
And he has a broken nose.

204
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,460
To make an omelet, you need to break eggs.

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,980
No, no, no, you're going to break the bottle.

206
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,520
A pencil broken in two pieces.

207
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,740
One piece, another piece.

208
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,660
A piece of chalk.

209
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,060
A lump of sugar.

210
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,380
Pieces of bread.

211
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,040
Pieces of glass.

212
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,220
The boy picks up the pieces.

213
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,220
The glasses broke. Jean-Pierre's reaction is extremely vulgar.

214
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,220
Shit !

215
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,220
He said a word that shouldn't have been said, and it shouldn't have been said.

216
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
But there are French people who say so.

217
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Oh shit !

218
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,220
An hour ago?

219
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Shit! Shit!

220
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Oh shit !

221
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,220
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

222
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,220
Don't walk so fast, damn it!

223
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,840
When you're well-mannered, you don't say that. You say "darn" or "mind."

224
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,820
I have to go back to the clinic tomorrow. Yes, for two days.

225
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,280
Two days, wow, but that's going to cost you a fortune.

226
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,740
Jean-Pierre is ill-mannered. But Hubert is well-mannered.

227
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,420
That's bad luck then.

228
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,620
Marie-Laure dropped the snack tray.

229
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,660
That's bad luck

230
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,520
Mireille is stuck on her exam

231
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,900
That's bad luck

232
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,940
Oh darn, I'm stuck.

233
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,340
He missed his train

234
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,180
That's bad luck

235
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,120
We're on vacation and it's raining.

236
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,800
That's bad luck

237
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
She died

238
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,420
That's bad luck

239
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,160
She fell pale again

240
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,880
Ah, that's bad luck

241
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,860
Oh, all these broken glasses!

242
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,680
That's bad luck

243
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,920
That's bad luck

244
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,400
"No, on the contrary, it brings good luck, it's white glass."

245
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,860
That's not clear glass.

246
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,960
But that's white glass.

247
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,500
Well, they say that breaking white glass brings good luck.

248
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,100
A four-leaf clover also brings good luck.

249
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,900
A horseshoe also brings good luck.

250
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,500
But seeing a black cat, that brings bad luck.

251
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,840
Jean-Pierre is leaving.

252
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,760
Mireille is leaving

253
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,260
She's leaving

254
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,600
It's the verb "to leave".

255
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,340
Well, I'm leaving now.

256
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,860
She's leaving

257
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,680
Good morning

258
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,620
I'm leaving

259
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,940
Good evening, Dad

260
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,040
When are you coming back?

261
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Sunday afternoon or evening

262
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Now observe

263
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,520
Robert is leaving here

264
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,420
Goodbye, sir.

265
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,040
"Thank you, sir."

266
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Here, Robert takes his leave of the courteous ones.

267
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,740
"What a delicious meal and what a lovely evening. I don't know how to thank you."

268
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,060
" See you soon. "

269
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,780
Jean-Pierre leaves, but Hubert takes his leave.

270
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,120
He's taking leave. It's a different style.

271
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,760
Robert notices several couples holding hands

272
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,340
Here is a young couple holding hands

273
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,660
A young couple holding hands

274
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,680
An older couple holding hands

275
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,180
They are holding hands

276
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,780
And here's a couple holding arms

277
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,540
And a couple holding each other by the waist

278
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,960
I've got you, you've got me by the chin

279
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,260
The first one to laugh will get a slap.

280
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,460
There are many couples holding hands

281
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,280
But Robert doesn't dare take Mireille's hand.

282
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,080
You remember in Chartres, he wanted to buy a small gift for Mireille

283
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,960
But he didn't dare.

284
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
He doesn't dare

285
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,920
What else is there?

286
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,380
My Val fell into the lady's bag over there.

287
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,980
Well, go ask her.

288
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,660
I don't dare.

289
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,860
Ah, you could have told me sooner.

290
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,440
I didn't dare, I was afraid of compromising myself.

291
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,880
The little girls don't dare go into the water.

292
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,920
On the sidewalk, there is a National Lottery stand.

293
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,160
next to a newsstand.

294
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,300
A newsstand.

295
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,040
A newsstand.

296
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,280
A newsstand, a music kiosk and a lottery kiosk.

297
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,600
Robert wonders if it's possible to win the lottery.

298
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,380
Tell me, do you ever win this lottery?

299
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,800
I imagine so, but I've never won anything.

300
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,040
Here, Mireille won.

301
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,160
Who wins?

302
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,220
Here, Marie-Laure won.

303
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:49,860
You can win at racing, you can win at cards, you can win at roulette, you can win at horse races, but they, they didn't win.

304
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,020
But one can also win at another.

305
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,920
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

306
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,220
But there are rivals!

307
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,220
Yes, there, that idiot, there, let me pass!

308
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,620
We won!

309
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:13,400
We won! We won! We changed!

310
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,960
Do you remember the nun?

311
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,000
She wanted to sell me lottery tickets to win an old 16th-century priory.

312
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,940
Robert and Mireille agree that the lottery is not very moral.

313
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,180
But Mireille says that part of the money goes to charitable organizations.

314
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,080
In any case, part of the money goes to a good cause.

315
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,120
For orphans, for tuberculosis patients.

316
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,100
Orphans, children who have no parents.

317
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,920
People with tuberculosis have a lung disease.

318
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,380
Mireille has never won anything in the lottery.

319
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,580
I must say that I have never bought tickets.

320
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,680
Perhaps that's why she never won anything.

321
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,780
Do you buy national lottery tickets?

322
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,180
Never.

323
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,560
Did you win the national lottery?

324
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,040
No, because I'm not buying tickets.

325
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,640
That professor is a bit dim. You don't buy tickets? Never.

326
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,560
And at the national lottery, you buy national lottery tickets?

327
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh no, I don't believe it. You don't believe it. The lottery? No.

328
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,380
It doesn't work? No, it doesn't work.

329
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,200
We never win? Well no, I never win.

330
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,000
Even at the races. I was even surprised that I hadn't understood anything.

331
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,100
Robert and Mireille must be lucky right now.

332
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,320
With all this off-white glass

333
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,080
So, they decide to buy a ticket

334
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,260
Listen, next, you will play the role of Mireille

335
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,700
Okay, let's buy a ticket, shall we?

336
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,420
If that amuses you

337
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,480
Go ahead, choose.

338
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,740
Oh no, choose yourself

339
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,380
No, you

340
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,500
No, not me, I'm just not lucky at all.

341
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,420
Yes, you must be very lucky.

342
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,060
You just broke at least 12 white glasses

343
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,760
I didn't break them, you did.

344
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,420
Now it's your turn, you are Mireille.

345
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,960
Okay, let's buy a ticket, shall we?

346
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,480
If it amuses you, if it amuses you.

347
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,220
If that amuses you.

348
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,280
Go ahead, choose.

349
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,420
Oh no, choose yourself, oh no, choose yourself.

350
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,060
Oh no, choose yourself.

351
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,680
No, you.

352
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,800
No, not me, I'm just not lucky at all.

353
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,680
No, not me, I'm just not lucky at all.

354
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,500
No, not me, I'm just not lucky at all.

355
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,440
Yes, you must be very lucky.

356
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,760
You just broke at least 12 white glasses.

357
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
I didn't break them, you did.

358
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,640
I didn't break them, you did.

359
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,280
I didn't break them, you did.

360
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,720
No, it's not me, it's you.

361
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,080
Actually, no, it's Hubert, I saw him.

362
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,060
But that doesn't matter. Go ahead.

363
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,040
Take any number.

364
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,980
A random number. Any number.

365
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,720
Do you want a candy?

366
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,080
Oh yes.

367
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,320
Which one do you want?

368
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,660
I don't care, whichever one it is.

369
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,140
Take a card. Any card.

370
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,600
Go ahead, take any ticket as long as the last two digits add up to nine.

371
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,720
Provided that the last two digits add up to nine.

372
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:15,460
You can take any ticket, but the last two digits must add up to nine.

373
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,440
That is the only condition, the only restriction.

374
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,060
Hey Mum, could I watch the movie on TV tonight?

375
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,860
Yes, provided you have finished your homework.

376
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,340
Take any number as long as the last two digits add up to nine.

377
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:37,740
18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90.

378
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,200
Why is that?

379
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
But that's obvious!

380
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,700
The drinks cost exactly 135 francs. 3 and 1, 4 and 5, 9.

381
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,900
The drinks cost 135 francs. That's expensive.

382
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
But these seats are inexpensive.

383
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:03,080
And this cheese costs 47.50 francs per kilo.

384
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,080
Mireille chooses a ticket with a pink baby doll on it.

385
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,640
Here are some dolls, a doll, a doll and a celluloid baby doll.

386
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,200
And there you have it, a real baby doll, in the flesh.

387
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,160
And here are some babies in a nursery.

388
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:37,600
On the ticket, there is a pink baby doll on a pale blue background, a pale blue sweater and a dark blue sweater, a pale green skirt, a dark green skirt.

389
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,180
Robert would like Mireille to keep the ticket.

390
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,180
Here, keep it.

391
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,760
Oh no, not me, watch out.

392
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,860
Marie-Laure would really like Mireille's earrings.

393
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,320
Look at.

394
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,640
Wow, they're great.

395
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,740
Will you give them to me?

396
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,480
No, you're dreaming. That's not right, no, why would I give them to you?

397
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,560
But Mireille doesn't give them to him.

398
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,640
She keeps them.

399
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,180
And here, Marie-Laure gives Mireille a candy

400
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,380
and she keeps the others.

401
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,720
You take this candy and I'll take the others.

402
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,920
It's impossible to be that selfish.

403
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,780
Here, you can keep it.

404
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,540
She only has one candy left. So she keeps it.

405
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,200
Give me a chocolate.

406
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,360
I only have one left.

407
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,620
I'll buy it from you.

408
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,780
How much ?

409
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,760
50 cents.

410
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,260
I'm sorry. This chocolate is not for sale. I'm keeping it.

411
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,700
Now listen, observe, reflect, and speak.

412
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:50,160
Is the boy looking at the table where Robert and Mireille are, or is he looking elsewhere?

413
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,460
He's looking elsewhere.

414
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,600
He's looking elsewhere.

415
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,920
Are Robert's friends turning away or are they taking an interest in what is happening?

416
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,280
They turn away.

417
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,700
They turn away.

418
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,060
Does the boy put down his tray or does he pick it up?

419
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,320
they put it

420
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,940
They ask, does Jean-Claude pick up the newspaper or does he...

421
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:32,240
Forget it, he'll pick it up, he'll pick it up, according to Mireille, if we break some

422
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,040
White glass, does it bring good luck or bad luck? It brings good luck.

423
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:57,300
Happiness. Look at Jean-Pierre. Is he leaving or is he taking his leave? He's leaving. He's leaving. And Hubert? He's taking his leave. Goodbye, my dear. He's taking his leave. Goodbye, everyone.

424
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,760
Why doesn't Robert take Mireille's hand?

425
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,040
He doesn't dare.

426
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,820
He doesn't dare.

427
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,880
What is it? A newsstand or a toasted sandwich stand?

428
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,300
A newsstand.

429
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,640
A newsstand. Very well. And this?

430
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,320
A National Lottery stand.

431
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,120
A National Lottery stand. That's it.

432
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,300
Shall we go and buy a National Lottery ticket?

433
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,480
I don't like it very much.

434
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,640
No, it's a bit against my principles.

435
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,940
That's not exactly in line with my principles either.

436
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,580
But I would need some fresh cash.

437
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,060
Yes, okay, if you want.

438
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,140
Are you two still here?

439
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,380
It's getting late, come on, we need to go to bed.

440
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,920
Okay, take your leave.

441
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,360
Say goodbye.

442
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,360
Bye.

443
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Bye !

444
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
