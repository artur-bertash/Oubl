and get involved pretty soon you will figure out what's going on and be able

3
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,120
to say a few things in French yourself

4
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,000
lesson 9 takes us back a few years to vacation time in Brittany it's raining

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,180
Mireille her sisters and cousins decide to pass the time by playing a game of

6
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,980
portraits their game is interrupted by a minor accident

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,880
Two years ago, the summer holidays

8
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,360
at Belle-Île-en-Mer, in Brittany.

9
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,060
It's raining.

10
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
Mireille, Cécile, Marie-Laure,

11
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,800
their cousin Georges and their cousin Yvonne

12
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,800
are alone in a house rented jointly by the two families.

13
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,680
That's our lucky break.

14
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,620
It has been raining for three days.

15
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,060
Your Brittany is beautiful.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,640
Yes, the sea is deadly when it rains.

17
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,780
There's nothing to be done.

18
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,000
Shall we play belote?

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,900
Playing belote in the house? We don't have the space.

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,020
No, Bécasse, it's belote, not pelota.

21
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,320
Are you deaf or something?

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,300
We're not going to play Basque pelota in Brittany.

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,140
But we can play cards.

24
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,540
At belote, bridge, poker, écarté.

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,480
How boring.

26
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,960
You can play chess or checkers.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,160
We can play chess

28
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,520
Or, for the ladies, it's less complicated.

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,840
Oh no, all of this is deadly

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,480
Let's play at drawing portraits instead.

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,380
Yes, that's an idea, let's play portraits.

32
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,820
That's it, let's make some portraits.

33
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,740
How do we play the portrait game?

34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,600
It's very easy

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,860
Someone describes a person in three or four sentences

36
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,560
For example

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
She is tall, she has one blue eye, she has one grey eye.

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,220
She is very kind.

39
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,100
And then the others, guess who they are.

40
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,560
Who is it?

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,560
Who ?

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,800
Tall, with one blue eye, one grey eye, and very kind.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,940
I don't know. It's nobody.

44
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,580
It doesn't exist. It's an example.

45
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,760
Really? We're inventing people who don't exist?

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,520
No way! Can you be stupid?

47
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,660
When we play, we use real people.

48
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,320
Obviously, otherwise we can't guess. Okay, let's begin. We'll start with...

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,780
Family people, what's starting? She's yours, Yvonne, you

50
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,360
Start, I have no idea, but yes, let's see, it's not difficult, you take

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Someone from the family, anyone, is waiting, I'm looking for

52
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Ah, that's it, I know. He's tall, he has short gray hair, he's always tanned, he has a good character, he's always in a good mood, he's very generous, he always gives gifts, he loves...

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,280
Uncle Guillaume, that's too easy.

54
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,100
What does Uncle Guillaume like?

55
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,620
Children, Bécasse.

56
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,960
Okay, it's my turn now.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:14,020
A fine, pointed nose, thin lips, sharp teeth, and a high-pitched voice.

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,960
Ah, that kid is so annoying!

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,960
So many Georgettes!

60
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,600
Okay, me now.

61
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,900
The great athlete, very proud of his achievements,

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,440
moved on to running, the 100 meters, the 400 meters,

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,440
in the marathon, the high jump, the pole vault,

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,160
In short, the perfect athlete.

65
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,080
Never miss a sporting event.

66
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,100
As a spectator.

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,660
On TV, obviously.

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,020
And he even plays tennis.

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,120
Once a year.

70
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,240
Oh dear, how mean she is, that's Dad.

71
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,160
Obviously, it's your father.

72
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,160
Okay, my turn.

73
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,040
With a distinguished air,

74
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,040
delicate hands,

75
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,040
blue eyes,

76
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,880
blond hair,

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,780
The whole portrait of his second daughter.

78
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
Oh, how gallant the little cousin is.

79
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,380
Okay, we're not going to say who it is.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,980
Yes, yes, we'll say who it is.

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,700
Who it is, who it is, it's not important.

82
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,420
What's important is the snack.

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
It's 4 o'clock, past 4 o'clock.

84
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,800
Come on, children, it's past 4 o'clock, it's snack time.

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,940
Tell me, tell me who it is.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,020
Oh, but shut up, you're being annoying.

87
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,080
Tell me who it is, I want to know who it is, na.

88
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,800
First, you go get the snack.

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,520
I'm not your maid, go ahead.

90
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,180
Listen, do you want to know who it is?

91
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,620
Yes.

92
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,180
So, go get the snack.

93
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,600
Ah, can you be annoying?

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
She is not happy.

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,860
But she's going.

96
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,400
Bring some Orangina and lemonade.

97
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,500
Orangina and lemonade.

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,400
There are raisin buns.

99
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,900
And raisin buns.

100
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
Bring the Breton galettes too.

101
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,920
Breton galettes?

102
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,260
There aren't any left.

103
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,820
Yes, there are some left.

104
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,100
Yes, there are at least five or six left.

105
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,620
There are none left.

106
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,600
Are you sure?

107
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,300
Of course I'm sure, since I'm telling you so.

108
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,760
Oh, you can believe me, right?

109
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,800
But soon, there won't be any left.

110
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,840
Be careful what you do!

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,980
Oh, that's clever!

112
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,880
It's not my fault.

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,660
Listen, it's not a big deal. Come on, don't cry.

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
So, who is it?

115
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:20,600
The story takes place in the past, two years ago.

116
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,400
That's in the past.

117
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,320
Let's take a trip, for example.

118
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,620
That's the present, today.

119
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:47,860
And that's the past. 100 years ago. That's Mireille now, today. That's Mireille 3 years ago. That's Mireille 10 years ago. That's 2 years ago. And this is in Brittany. It's the holidays.

120
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,700
Look at that. Is this the holidays? No.

121
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,640
These people are not on vacation.

122
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,860
And now? Is it vacation time? No.

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,580
Yes, that's what holidays are all about.

124
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,440
These people, on the other hand, are on vacation.

125
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,900
Summer holidays.

126
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,080
That's what holidays are, but winter holidays.

127
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,840
And that's what holidays in Brittany are all about.

128
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,680
Mireille, Cécile and Marie-Laure are on holiday in Brittany.

129
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,700
There are also their cousins, Georges and Yvonne.

130
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,140
The parents are not there. The children are alone, without their parents.

131
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,860
Here, Mireille and Marie-Laure are alone.

132
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,540
But here, they are not alone.

133
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,380
This gentleman is alone. But here, no, here he is not alone.

134
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:51,180
Well, Mireille and her sisters are alone in a rented house. It's a rented house, a house for rent.

135
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:58,000
If you are on holiday, winter holidays, and you don't have skis, you can rent skis.

136
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:05,700
Look at that lady, she's renting skis. If you don't have a car, you can rent one.

137
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:13,880
That car doesn't belong to Robert. Robert doesn't own a car. It's a rental car. He rents it.

138
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:23,060
This house in Brittany isn't for cycling. It's a rental property. He rents it out for holidays.

139
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,760
Mireille is not happy. Listen.

140
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,140
That's just our luck. It's been raining for three days.

141
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
Your Brittany is beautiful.

142
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:50,580
She is not happy because it is raining, it is raining, it is raining here too, it is raining there too, it has been raining for three days, look.

143
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,980
Today, July 6th, it is raining.

144
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,980
It's been raining for a day.

145
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,080
Yesterday, July 5th, it rained.

146
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,000
So it's been raining for two days now.

147
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,040
And the day before yesterday, July 4th, it rained.

148
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,760
So it's been raining for three days now.

149
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
It's been raining for a day.

150
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,980
It has been raining for two days.

151
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,960
It has been raining for three days.

152
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,100
That's our lucky break.

153
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,260
Mireille, Cécile, and Georges are unlucky.

154
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,800
They're unlucky because they're on vacation and it's raining.

155
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,080
They, yes, they, are lucky

156
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,240
They are on vacation and the weather is nice, it's not raining.

157
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,020
They are lucky

158
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,700
This gentleman is lucky

159
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,860
Mireille is unlucky, look

160
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,360
Damn, what's wrong?

161
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,240
Well, look, this is my chance, isn't it? This is my chance.

162
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,380
That's our lucky break.

163
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,340
But your Brittany is beautiful, isn't it?

164
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,860
Mireille says that because she's not happy.

165
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,360
But, in fact, yes, Brittany is beautiful, very beautiful.

166
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,880
Brittany is beautiful. It's a very beautiful country.

167
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,420
There are beautiful beaches, beautiful calvaries, and pretty little fishing ports.

168
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,000
When the weather is nice, it's a very beautiful country.

169
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,560
But, obviously, when it rains, it's less beautiful.

170
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,820
The sea is deadly when it rains.

171
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,880
It's sad, it's boring

172
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,240
We're bored because there's nothing to do

173
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,260
I'm bored, there's nothing to do

174
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,300
This young man is bored because he has nothing to do.

175
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,560
At the seaside, when it rains, what can you do?

176
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,300
Nothing !

177
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,120
We can't play ball

178
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:49,460
We can't go boating, we can't go windsurfing, we can't do anything.

179
00:11:49,920 --> 00:12:01,420
Yes, we can play chess, we can play checkers, we can play cards, bridge, poker, écarté, belote.

180
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,580
Playing belote in the house? We don't have the space.

181
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,880
No, Bécasse, it's belote, not pelota.

182
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:26,640
Belote is a card game. Mireille and Marie-Laure are playing belote. Pelote, now that's something else. Pelote is a game from the Basque Country. Georges isn't very nice to Marie-Laure. He calls her a silly goose.

183
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,260
No, you silly goose.

184
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:48,820
"Silly, idiot, that's not very nice. That's a silly girl. People say silly girls are stupid. A silly girl is a little girl who isn't very quick-witted. That's Bécassine, a maid who isn't very quick-witted. She's a bit silly."

185
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:57,280
Is Marie-Laure a bit of a simpleton or is she deaf?

186
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,080
Belote and pelote are not the same thing. They are different.

187
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,820
Are you deaf or something?

188
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,820
Is Marie-Laure deaf?

189
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,780
Look at Jean-Claude here. He is deaf.

190
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,460
This gentleman is also deaf. He can't hear very well.

191
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:24,480
Mireille, Cécile and the others are bored because it's raining and they can't do anything.

192
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,520
But Mireille has an idea.

193
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,160
Okay, I have an idea.

194
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,400
Let's play portrait.

195
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,320
Yes, that's an idea. It's a good idea. It could be fun.

196
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,180
Here, it's Newton who has an idea.

197
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,700
Mireille's idea is to play at portraiture.

198
00:13:42,700 --> 00:14:09,040
When you are on vacation, you can go windsurfing, you can go swimming, you can go hang gliding, you can go skiing, you can go rock climbing, or you can play belote, play hopscotch, you can play tennis.

199
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,540
Swimming is a sport, an activity, a sport that is good for your health.

200
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,220
Belote is a game, a game with rules.

201
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,280
Scrabble is also a game, a game with rules.

202
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,860
Mireille, Cécile and the others are going to play portrait.

203
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,600
Portraits are a game, a game with a rule.

204
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:51,980
Someone describes a person. Someone, that is to say, anyone. For example, Mireille or Cécile or Marie-Laure or Georges or you or me or this gentleman.

205
00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:03,200
This lady is someone. Someone is masculine. A lady, feminine, is someone, masculine.

206
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:13,860
So, to play the portrait game, someone describes a person. For example, Mireille, Cécile, Georges, or you, or this gentleman.

207
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,240
That's a person.

208
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,000
Now, pay attention. Observe this carefully.

209
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,740
A man, masculine, is a person.

210
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,260
Female.

211
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,280
To play the portrait game, you have to describe someone in three or four sentences.

212
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,100
For example, he has a round face, blue eyes, blond hair, and a mustache.

213
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,560
Three or four sentences.

214
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,980
Someone describes a person and the others guess who it is.

215
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,640
We need to find out who it is.

216
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,640
Look, in this game too, you have to guess who it is.

217
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,780
Ah, it's Georges!

218
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,080
Oh, she guessed it!

219
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,460
Guess what I have.

220
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,560
I don't know.

221
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,600
A snake!

222
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,800
Ah!

223
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:15,300
Guess who this is, Georgette! You have to guess who it is. What can I ask you? How old is she?

224
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:27,000
You guessed who it is, the tall one with one blue eye and one grey eye, who is very kind, I don't know

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:38,220
Not if nobody, nobody, look at that, that's a person and that's nobody, a person

226
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:48,040
Nobody there, there's someone, there's a person, and there's nobody there. Is there someone here?

227
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:57,220
Someone? Is there someone here? No, there's no one. Ah, ah, yes, yes, yes, there is someone.

228
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,920
Careful, now it's going to get very complicated. Look. Is there anyone in the

229
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,600
Room? Yes, there are two people. And now, is there anyone in the room? No,

230
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,720
Now, there's no one here. Playing the role of portrait artist isn't difficult. First,

231
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
We need to choose someone.

232
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,300
Yes, come on, it's not difficult.

233
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,820
You take someone from the family.

234
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,040
Anyone.

235
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,540
Georges says we need to take someone from the family.

236
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,880
It's easier.

237
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,860
Look at Mireille here.

238
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,380
She takes a candy.

239
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,460
And Marie-Laure takes the others.

240
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,040
You take this candy.

241
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,500
And I'll take the others.

242
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,920
Look at Marie-Laure.

243
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,500
She takes a pancake and eats it.

244
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,860
Here, take your raincoat, it's better

245
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,840
Okay, so, what are you having?

246
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,760
I think I'll take the cream-coated puppy

247
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,160
Now, observe Yvonne, she is looking

248
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,520
I'm looking... Let's see... Ah, that's it, I know

249
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,720
Now look at Marie-Laure, she's looking for her Asterix.

250
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,540
What are you doing?

251
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,700
I'm looking for my Asterix.

252
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,780
Look at this lady.

253
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,440
She is searching.

254
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,680
She's looking for something.

255
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,720
Now, look at Jean-Claude.

256
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,220
He is searching.

257
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,640
Yvonne describes a person with round cheeks.

258
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,980
Round cheeks, like that.

259
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,680
Hollow cheeks.

260
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,500
Round cheeks.

261
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,800
Those are round cheeks.

262
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,960
And here's someone with a fresh complexion.

263
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,700
But no, that's not it. That's not a fresh complexion.

264
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,260
Yvonne describes someone who is always in a good mood.

265
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,320
Here is a lady who is in a good mood.

266
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,500
But here, she is not in a good mood.

267
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,440
Yvonne describes someone who is generous.

268
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,120
Here is a generous man. Here is a generous lady.

269
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,600
Georges describes someone with a pointed nose

270
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,220
That's a round nose

271
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,200
And there's a pointy nose!

272
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,480
Sharp teeth

273
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
Pointy ears

274
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,760
A pointed leaf

275
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,440
Thick lips

276
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,720
Thin lips

277
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,020
Mireille makes fun of her uncle

278
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,260
Georges and Yvonne's father.

279
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,880
She makes fun of him because he is proud

280
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,080
of his past sporting performances.

281
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,540
Marie-Laure is very proud of her skirt.

282
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
Look at Jean-Claude, he's proud.

283
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,720
The great sportsman, very proud of his past performances.

284
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,140
In the race, the 100 meters, the 400 meters,

285
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,820
In the marathon, the high jump, the pole vault, the perfect athlete, in short.

286
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:31,560
Running, here it's a cycling race, a car race, high jump, pole vault.

287
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,480
Marie-Laure also does rope jumping.

288
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Mireille makes fun of Uncle Armand because he's not a real sportsman.

289
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:49,160
He doesn't really play sports, but he watches all the sporting events on television.

290
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,100
Now that's a real sportsman, he does sports.

291
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,200
But that, that's not a real sportsman.

292
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,300
He doesn't play sports, he watches the matches on TV.

293
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,460
But he watches all the matches.

294
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,680
He watches all the rugby matches.

295
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,120
He never misses a rugby match.

296
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,480
He watches all the tennis matches.

297
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,220
He never misses a tennis match.

298
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,240
Georges is painting a portrait of Mrs. Belleau.

299
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,400
He says she looks distinguished.

300
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:25,620
A distinguished air, slender hands, blue eyes, blond hair.

301
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,940
And that she resembles Mireille.

302
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,680
A complete portrait of his second daughter.

303
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,640
Cécile is Mrs. Belleau's first daughter.

304
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,640
Mireille is his second daughter.

305
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,020
And Marie-Laure, his third daughter.

306
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,540
Oh, how gallant the little cousin is.

307
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,100
Georges is gallant because he pays Mireille a compliment.

308
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,220
He says she looks distinguished.

309
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,380
The French think they are gallant.

310
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,440
They love to talk about French gallantry.

311
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,840
Here, look.

312
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,920
My respects, madam.

313
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,040
That's a gallant Frenchman.

314
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,300
Here's another gallant Frenchman.

315
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,980
All Frenchmen are gallant.

316
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,000
Finally, almost all French people are gallant.

317
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,040
He is not gallant.

318
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,300
Marie-Laure doesn't know who it is.

319
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,600
We take a portrait, but she doesn't know who it is.

320
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,300
The distinguished air, the delicate hands, etc.

321
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,760
She doesn't know.

322
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,600
So, she wants to know.

323
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,060
Tell me who it is, I want to know who it is.

324
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,000
When you're a 10-year-old girl like Marie-Laure,

325
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,320
You need to know a lot of things.

326
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,080
You need to know your multiplication table.

327
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,340
Note 9 x 8, 72, 10 x 8, 80.

328
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,560
You need to know La Fontaine's fables.

329
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,600
Master Crow, perched on a tree, held a cheese in his beak.

330
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,160
Observe this.

331
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,560
First, go get the snack.

332
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,040
I'm not your maid, go do it yourself.

333
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,800
Marie-Laure protests that she is not Mireille's maid.

334
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,380
Look here, that's a maid, that's Madame Courtois' maid.

335
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,660
Madame Courtois ?

336
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,760
Oh no, that's the right one.

337
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,740
That's the right one.

338
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,500
That's a good one too.

339
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,220
Bécassine is a good one.

340
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:17,600
For a snack, there are Oranginas or lemonade to drink.

341
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,060
And for food, there are raisin buns, biscuits, and Breton galettes.

342
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,160
Look, how many pancakes are there?

343
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,840
One, two, three, four.

344
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
There are four pancakes.

345
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:50,480
Now there are three pancakes left. There are three left. And now there are two left. Now there is one left. And now there are none left. There are none left.

346
00:23:50,480 --> 00:24:06,000
There's one pancake left, there's one pancake left, there's one left, there are zero pancakes left, there are zero left, there are none left

347
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,600
Marie-Laure goes to get the snack and when she comes back, disaster strikes, she drops everything

348
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,180
Mireille criticizes

349
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,360
Oh, that's clever.

350
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,720
Look at this young girl

351
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,840
Oh, that's clever.

352
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,500
Notice that Mireille also makes mistakes, look

353
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,960
Shit

354
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,660
What, what is it?

355
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,220
But look

356
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,860
That's clever.

357
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,120
But it's not my fault

358
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,920
Maybe it's my fault

359
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:41,220
That's clever, can't you be careful, you dirty little girl?

360
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,540
It's not my fault, I didn't do it on purpose

361
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:57,700
It's not my fault, she's crying. It's raining and she's crying. Now you're going to speak French.

362
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:04,300
Listen to this dialogue between Mireille and Marie-Laure. You will repeat Mireille's answers.

363
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,940
Who is it? I want to know who it is! First, you go get the snack. I'm not your maid.

364
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
Go ahead, you.

365
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Listen, do you want to know who it is?

366
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
Yes.

367
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,940
So, go get the snack.

368
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,940
Now it's your turn. You are Mireille.

369
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,940
Tell me who it is. I want to know who it is. No.

370
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,940
First, you're going to go get the snack.

371
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,940
First, you're going to go get the snack.

372
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
Now it's your turn.

373
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
First, you're going to go get the snack.

374
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,940
Yes, I'm not your maid. Go ahead.

375
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,940
Listen, do you want to know who it is?

376
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,940
Listen, do you want to know who it is?

377
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,360
Listen, do you want to know who it is?

378
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,620
Listen, do you want to know who it is?

379
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,060
Yes.

380
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Now go get the snack.

381
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Now go get the snack.

382
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,560
Now go get the snack.

383
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,140
Okay, to finish up, let's see what you know how to do.

384
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,520
How many pancakes are there?

385
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,260
Four.

386
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,840
There are four pancakes.

387
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:26,680
There are four pancakes left. Very good. And now, how many are left? There are three left. And now, there are two left. And now, there is one left. And now, there are none left.

388
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,900
Two young people.

389
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,340
There's one left.

390
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,340
There are none left.

391
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,280
It's over.

392
