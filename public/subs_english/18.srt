3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,360
Paris, the Latin Quarter.

4
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,660
The district of schools, faculties, the district of studies and students.

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,900
His name is Robert.

6
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,180
Her name is Mireille.

7
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,920
Are they students? Yes, probably.

8
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,520
Look, they're talking.

9
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,460
The students study, they demonstrate, and the rest of the time they discuss.

10
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,240
Robert invited Mireille to have something.

11
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,580
What? I don't know.

12
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,580
At the Lilas farm.

13
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,140
They crossed the Luxembourg Gardens,

14
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,120
passed by the Institute of Art and Archaeology,

15
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,480
where Mireille is taking a course.

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,680
The room on the right is the Institute of Art and Archaeology.

17
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,020
I'm taking a course in Greek art there.

18
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,480
And they sat down on the terrace of the Closerie des Lilas.

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,400
It was 11:15 on the observatory clock

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,500
And 5:15 on Robert's watch

21
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,300
What time is it?

22
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,400
11:00, 11:15, 11:15

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,940
I still had the New York time

24
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,860
Why did you want to come here?

25
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,660
You know, I don't know many cafes in Paris.

26
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,040
I knew this one because of Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein.

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,740
You never come here?

28
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,760
No, this is the first time.

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,140
You don't like it?

30
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,980
Yes, yes. But it's a bit too fancy and too expensive for a poor little student like me.

31
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,980
When I want to have coffee with my friends, I usually go to a small bistro in the neighborhood.

32
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,740
What can I get you?

33
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,420
Let's see.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,520
Hemingway probably drank whisky, but that's not particularly French.

35
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,100
What are some typical French aperitifs?

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,580
You have the Dubonnet, the Martini.

37
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,160
That's Italian, isn't it?

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,840
The Ambassador, Pernod, Ricard.

39
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,880
I love Pernod, but it's a bit too strong.

40
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,060
Suze, Pinot des Charentes, Saint Raphaël, Bir, Kir.

41
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,920
That's it, I'll have a Kir.

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,980
And what about the gentleman?

43
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,700
The same.

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,820
So you're studying art history.

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,340
Yes, I have always loved drawing and painting.

46
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,920
Even as a very young child in kindergarten, I would delight in plunging my fingers into pots of colors.

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,900
And I dabbled in admirable abstract paintings.

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,580
I was unbeatable. I was the class champion.

49
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,460
And I kept the title until the end of kindergarten.

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,080
Later in primary school, the teacher showed us reproductions of Matisse murals.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Overwhelmed with admiration, that very evening I set about covering the walls and ceiling of my room with frescoes.

52
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,360
My parents didn't appreciate it. In France, great artists are always misunderstood.

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,140
Matisse's paintings must have been an avant-garde school.

54
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,300
An avant-garde school? Why?

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,120
You know, Matisse was considered an avant-garde painter around 1910.

56
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,480
Was it a private school?

57
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,680
No, the local school. A public school.

58
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,340
It must have been a good school.

59
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,640
Meh, like all the others.

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,240
You know, in France, all schools are pretty much the same.

61
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,000
Generally speaking, it is the State that finances and controls national education.

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,780
And the system is the same throughout France.

63
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,500
Then later in high school, you continued to make art and study art history.

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
But no, you might think. There are so many other subjects to study.

65
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,540
Just in history, for example. We study ancient history, the history of France,

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,480
the Middle Ages, modern times, the contemporary era, the history of foreign countries.

67
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,080
It never ends, not to mention the geography.

68
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,240
That doesn't leave much time for art history.

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:34,960
THANKS.

70
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,540
THANKS.

71
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:35,600
THANKS.

72
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,260
I took a course in European history.

73
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,380
When I was in high school in the United States

74
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,840
I didn't like it very much.

75
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,940
Too many kings, too many wars

76
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,260
But are you obligated to study history?

77
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,120
Of course, history is mandatory

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
Like almost all materials, for that matter.

79
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,540
You know, until the first year of high school, we don't have many choices.

80
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,220
Which course did you take?

81
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,960
Well, I did A in my first year

82
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,540
That is to say, the letters section

83
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,700
I studied Latin, but not Greek.

84
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,440
And then I took the courses common to all sections.

85
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,520
I studied French, naturally.

86
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,780
Maths, unfortunately, because I've always been terrible at maths.

87
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
I almost failed my baccalaureate exam because of math.

88
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,600
And then I studied natural sciences.

89
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,260
Zoology, geology, physiology, botany.

90
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,140
I really enjoyed botany, because of the flowers.

91
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,860
I love flowers. I was very good at botany.

92
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,380
And then I did chemistry, physics, what else?

93
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,820
De la philo en terminale.

94
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,540
The last year of high school before the baccalaureate exam.

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,100
And then I studied languages, German and English.

96
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,760
Ah, you know English?

97
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,920
Yes, a little. But I didn't learn it in high school.

98
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,760
I completed three years of study in England.

99
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,580
Foreign languages ​​are taught rather poorly in high school.

100
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,220
And you can imagine that with all the subjects on the curriculum,

101
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,000
You never really know anything completely.

102
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,600
Even if you don't learn anything thoroughly, it all gives the impression of an enormous amount of work.

103
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,380
Yes, there's work to be done.

104
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,240
The worst part is working from home.

105
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,640
Homework to do, lessons to learn, written tests to prepare for.

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,500
Not to mention the obsession with getting the baccalaureate at the end of studies.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,640
In short, you must be very glad to have finished with high school.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,620
Yes, you can say that again.

109
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,840
Now, at university, I feel much freer.

110
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,580
I enjoy all the courses I'm taking.

111
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,300
Especially the Greek art courses.

112
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,540
The teacher is a sweetheart.

113
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,900
He is as handsome as a god and so spiritual.

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,460
It's a delight to listen to him.

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,440
Okay, so be careful.

116
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,400
Today, we're going to talk about schools.

117
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,960
Let's go.

118
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,700
Last time, Robert and Mireille were in Luxembourg.

119
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,360
Robert invited Mireille to have something at the Closerie des Lilas.

120
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,540
They got up, they crossed the garden,

121
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:06,420
They passed by the Institute of Art and Archaeology, arrived at the enclosed garden and sat down.

122
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,300
Mireille sat down, then Robert sat down.

123
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,500
That's in the past.

124
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,920
That happened last time.

125
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,040
These are verbs in the past tense.

126
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,680
He avoided it, they crossed, they passed, they arrived, they sat down.

127
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,980
Note that these verbs are composed of two parts.

128
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,120
That's why we call this past tense the passé composé.

129
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:43,160
The passé composé is composed of a form of the verb, the past participle, invited, crossed, past, arrived, and an auxiliary.

130
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:53,780
A, on, that's the verb "to have." It's the present tense of the verb "to have." And "son" is the verb "to be." The present tense of the verb "to be."

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,180
In summary, the passé composé is composed of an auxiliary verb, avoir or être, and the past participle of the verb.

132
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,580
So now we have two past tenses: the imperfect and the passé composé.

133
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:22,240
For example, if I say last time Robert and Mireille were in Luxembourg, they were talking sitting on a bench, they were sitting, they were talking, that is the imperfect tense.

134
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:43,680
But if I say Robert invited Mireille, they got up, they crossed the garden, they arrived at the enclosure, they sat down, invited, got up, crossed, arrived, sat down, that is the past tense.

135
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,120
When Robert and Mireille sat down on the terrace of the enclosed garden,

136
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,860
It was 11:15 on the observatory clock

137
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,860
and five o'clock, fifteen, five and a quarter according to Robert's watch.

138
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,780
That's a clock.

139
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,460
And this is a watch.

140
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,860
And that's a clock.

141
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,360
A watch, a clock.

142
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,100
Let's see, what time is it?

143
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,720
It is 4:15 AM here, 4:15 AM.

144
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,600
It is 3:20 AM here.

145
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,560
It is 10:30 here, 10:30.

146
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,080
And what time is it here?

147
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,260
Here, it is 3:45, or a quarter to 4.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,640
Here, it is 8:50, or 7:40.

149
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,520
And here, it is 9:55, or 8:55.

150
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:52,520
And here, it's 4:10, well, not exactly, it's about 4:10.

151
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,880
And here, it is 3:46 PM.

152
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,520
When you want to be precise, you don't say approximately 4:45, you say 3:46 PM.

153
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,720
Train schedules and flight schedules, for example, use this 24-hour system.

154
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,920
Look. What time is this train?

155
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,040
17h51.

156
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,600
Look. What time is this train?

157
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
17h49.

158
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,740
And this bus, it leaves at 2:10 pm and arrives at 2:43 pm.

159
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:42,640
When Robert and Mireille arrived at the farmhouse, it was around 11:15 on the observatory clock and 5:15 on Robert's watch.

160
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,300
When you come from the United States, you have to set your watch forward 6 hours because of the time difference

161
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,780
The Paris Observatory is very close to the Closerie des Lilas.

162
00:11:52,780 --> 00:12:07,240
Robert chose La Closerie because it is a fairly famous cafe, a literary cafe where many poets and writers used to come, Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein and many others.

163
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,140
Does Mireille come to the Closerie often?

164
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
No, this is the first time.

165
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,300
This isn't a cafe for students, it's a bit too posh and too expensive.

166
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,940
But it's a bit too fancy and too expensive for a poor little student like me.

167
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,820
It's chic, it's elegant. Look at that. Is it chic? Yes, it's quite chic.

168
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,860
And that, that too, is chic. And this, is that a chic café? Yes, it's chic.

169
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,380
It's chic and it's expensive. Generally, chic places are expensive.

170
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,560
When Mireille wants to have a coffee, she doesn't go to a big, fancy, expensive cafe.

171
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,020
She usually goes to a small bistro.

172
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,740
It may be less chic, but it's also cheaper.

173
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,680
That's a great coffee shop.

174
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,180
That's a small bistro.

175
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,960
Mireille doesn't want to order whisky because it's not French.

176
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,620
She's looking for a very French aperitif.

177
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,180
What kind of typically French aperitif do you have?

178
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,300
There are many appetizers.

179
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,160
There's Dubonnet, Martini, Pastis, Suze, Ricard, Muscat,

180
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,120
and many others.

181
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,120
Finally, she chose a kheer.

182
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,060
Okay, I'm going to have a kheer.

183
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,380
It's a little crème de cassis with white wine.

184
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
Robert is not familiar with all of these aperitifs.

185
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,960
He doesn't know what to take.

186
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,880
So, he takes the same thing.

187
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,520
The same applies to the gentleman.

188
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,940
And enjoy!

189
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,380
And then, you're going to play the role of Mireille.

190
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,660
You have the Dubonnet, the Martini.

191
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,420
That's Italian, isn't it?

192
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,540
The Ambassador, Pernod, Ricard.

193
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,380
Ah, Pernod, I love it, but it's a bit too strong.

194
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,980
Suze, Pinot des Charentes, Saint-Raphaël, Bir, Kyr.

195
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,780
Okay, I'll have a Kyr.

196
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,960
To you, you are Mireille.

197
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,500
You have the Dubonnet, the Martini.

198
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,420
That's Italian, isn't it? That's Italian, isn't it?

199
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,520
That's Italian, isn't it?

200
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,260
The Ambassador, Pernod, Ricard.

201
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,380
I love Pernod, but it's a bit too strong.

202
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,280
I love Pernod, but it's a bit too strong.

203
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,620
I love Pernod, but it's a bit too strong.

204
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,420
Suze, Pinot des Charentes, Saint-Raphaël, Bir, Kyr.

205
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,380
Oh, that's it, I'll have a Kyr.

206
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,420
Oh, that's it, I'll have a Kyr.

207
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,900
Oh, that's it, I'll have a Kyr.

208
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,140
Robert resumes the conversation.

209
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,480
SO?

210
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,620
So, you're studying art history.

211
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,520
Mireille loves drawing and painting.

212
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,540
Here's a drawing.

213
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,620
Ah, and what about my drawing, huh?

214
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,720
Here's someone who paints.

215
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,180
Here is a painting.

216
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,960
She is a painter, she paints.

217
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,160
He also paints.

218
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,140
Even when she was little, Mireille loved painting.

219
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,180
She dipped her fingers into the paint pots and daubed admirable abstract paintings.

220
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,640
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's all covered in chocolate.

221
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,760
Look, you're all smeared with sweat.

222
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,040
She's all smeared with jam.

223
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,100
Mireille was very good at drawing and painting.

224
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,040
She was the champion of the class.

225
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,160
A champion, a female champion.

226
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,280
She was unbeatable.

227
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,580
Look at Marie-Laure here

228
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,600
She is very good at arithmetic.

229
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,360
She is unbeatable

230
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,500
9 x 6

231
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,220
54

232
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,560
7 x 7

233
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,160
49

234
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,200
9 x 9

235
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,900
81

236
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,040
You're unbeatable

237
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,700
Yeah, I'm a champion.

238
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,820
She is very strong

239
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,520
She is unbeatable

240
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,440
When she was very little

241
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,260
When she was 5 years old

242
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,900
Mireille went to nursery school

243
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:11,760
Then she went to primary school. After primary school, she went to secondary school, then middle school, and finally high school.

244
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,780
She passed her baccalaureate and went to university. Now she's at university, at college.

245
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,460
This is a nursery school. Nursery school is for toddlers.

246
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,620
Primary school is for slightly older children, roughly between 6 and 11 years old.

247
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,900
We learn to read, to write, to count.

248
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,440
After primary school, there is secondary school, middle school and high school.

249
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,580
When Mireille was in primary school, the teacher showed the children reproductions of Matisse.

250
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,500
Mireille thought it was very beautiful. She liked it.

251
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,240
She was very impressed. She was filled with admiration.

252
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,200
Ah, how handsome he is!

253
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,380
Here, Marie-Laure is filled with admiration for her new boat.

254
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,140
She likes him a lot; she finds him very handsome.

255
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,240
Ah, how handsome he is!

256
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,280
And this one, do you like it?

257
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,240
And Degas, do you like him?

258
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,540
Do you like your room?

259
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,100
Oh, she's magnificent!

260
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,620
So, do you like this big house?

261
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:24,860
Yes.

262
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,500
Observe this.

263
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,980
I like it, I enjoy it.

264
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,740
Mireille likes it, Mireille enjoys it, she likes it.

265
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,140
Look at Marie-Laure here.

266
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,600
Does she like chocolate mousse?

267
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,500
Does she think it's good?

268
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,700
Mmm, that's delicious.

269
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
Yes, she likes it, she enjoys it.

270
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,560
Now, look at Marie-Laure.

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,620
Do you find her pretty? Do you find her cute?

272
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,500
Do you like it?

273
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,440
Yes, I quite like her.

274
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,440
And Mireille, do you like her?

275
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,160
And Robert, do you find him handsome? Do you like him?

276
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,020
I see a guy every morning, I think I like him.

277
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,600
It's the verb "to please".

278
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,680
Mireille really liked the Matisse reproductions.

279
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,640
He liked them very much.

280
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,000
He likes them, that's the present.

281
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,820
They pleased him, that's the past, the past perfect.

282
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,560
So Mireille started painting on the walls and ceiling of her room.

283
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,660
That's a room, that's Marie-Laure's room.

284
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,200
That's a room too, it's a hotel room.

285
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,940
And this is Mireille's parents' bedroom.

286
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,640
Generally, a room has four walls and a ceiling.

287
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,020
A wall, a wall, a wall.

288
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,520
And he, he paints the ceiling.

289
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,400
A ceiling.

290
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,620
Mireille set about covering the walls and ceiling of her room with drawing.

291
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,760
She undertook, she began, that's the verb to undertake.

292
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,560
She set about covering the walls with drawings.

293
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,340
These are walls covered in drawings and graffiti.

294
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,680
A wall covered in posters.

295
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,740
And here's a table covered in numbers.

296
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,620
It's the verb "to cover".

297
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,560
But Mireille's parents didn't like her drawings.

298
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,800
They didn't understand that it was art.

299
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,740
Parents are stupid, they don't understand children.

300
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,040
Children are misunderstood.

301
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,860
Great artists are always misunderstood.

302
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,260
To understand, understood, misunderstood.

303
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,740
In France, there are two types of schools.

304
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,460
Public schools and private schools, generally religious.

305
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,420
Mireille went to a public school.

306
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,120
The local school, a school like any other.

307
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,360
In France, all schools are pretty much the same.

308
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,360
Did you go to primary school?

309
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,620
Yes.

310
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,900
Was it a public school or a private school?

311
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,100
It was a public school.

312
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,420
The school system is the same throughout France.

313
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,220
The state finances and controls national education.

314
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,940
After primary school, Mireille went to high school.

315
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,900
She studied a whole range of subjects.

316
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,460
She studied ancient history, Egypt, Greece, Rome.

317
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,480
She studied French history, all periods of French history,

318
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,000
the Middle Ages, modern times, and also the history of foreign countries,

319
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,120
Russia, England, Germany.

320
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,680
When you're French, Germany is a foreign country.

321
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,060
When you're German, France is a foreign country.

322
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,560
Everyone studies history in high school.

323
00:20:49,560 --> 00:21:10,920
Are you studying history? Yes. Is history good? I like it. Robert took a European history course, but he didn't like it. He didn't enjoy it. He thought there were too many wars, too many kings. But I didn't really like it either. Too many kings, too many wars.

324
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,420
Of course, in European history, there are many kings.

325
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:23,680
Look, just in France, you have François I, Henri II, Henri III, Charles IX, Louis XIII, Louis XIV, Louis XV.

326
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,380
There have been many kings and many wars.

327
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:35,500
The Gallic Wars, the Hundred Years' War, the Wars of Religion, the Napoleonic Wars, the First World War, the Second World War.

328
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,820
Mireille spent seven years in secondary school.

329
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,640
She entered sixth grade when she was eleven years old.

330
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:51,400
Then she did her fifth year, and then the fourth, the third, the second, the first and finally the final year.

331
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,800
Botany, that's what she really enjoyed. She liked it a lot.

332
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,020
She was very good at botany.

333
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,740
But math, no. She didn't like it. She didn't enjoy it.

334
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,580
She wasn't good at math. In fact, she was very bad at math.

335
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,540
She was useless, zero.

336
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,660
She always got bad grades, zeros.

337
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,460
So she didn't like it.

338
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,980
She hated math.

339
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,400
She is not the only one.

340
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,100
I hate math.

341
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,140
And do you like math?

342
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,460
None.

343
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,580
But that's not true, they're rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.

344
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,660
Mireille was so bad at math

345
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,500
that she almost failed her baccalaureate exam because of math.

346
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,480
Note that she did not fail her baccalaureate exam.

347
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,380
She didn't miss.

348
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,780
No, she succeeded.

349
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,700
Look at Jean-Claude here.

350
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,020
Okay, very good, he succeeded.

351
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,500
But there, I missed.

352
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,280
That's a failure.

353
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,920
But that's very good, it's a success.

354
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,440
Failed, succeeded.

355
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,440
That's a failure.

356
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,500
Look at that man over there.

357
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,000
He missed his train.

358
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,500
He didn't get it, he missed it.

359
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,280
He missed his train too.

360
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,220
And here, he didn't miss, he got it.

361
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,280
He caught his train, but he almost missed it.

362
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,120
Robert almost got run over

363
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
He almost had an accident

364
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,680
He too almost had an accident

365
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,240
And look at Jean-Claude here

366
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,800
He almost fell

367
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,520
Mireille almost failed her baccalaureate exam because of math.

368
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,560
But she didn't miss, she got him

369
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,640
She worked a lot

370
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,040
Because there is a lot of work in high school

371
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,700
There are too many things to take in

372
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,420
So we don't do anything thoroughly

373
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,400
We study everything superficially

374
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:45,920
Look at Mireille. She's studying superficially. Look here. The swimmer is on the surface. Here, she's at the bottom. Here, the miner is working on the surface. But here, he's working at the bottom.

375
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:58,340
Look at this woman. She's cleaning superficially. Here, she's cleaning thoroughly. There, the doctor is examining the patient superficially.

376
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,480
Here, he examines it thoroughly.

377
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,760
When you go to primary school, but especially to high school, there is a lot of work to do.

378
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,460
We don't feel free, we can't do what we want.

379
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,780
There are always lessons to learn or homework to do

380
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,940
Look, see Marie-Laure here

381
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,200
Have you done your homework?

382
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,140
No, not yet.

383
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,380
So you're going to do your homework and then we'll see.

384
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,720
You see, she is not free.

385
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,360
The prisoners are not free.

386
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,440
Children are not free either.

387
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,520
Since she started university, Mireille feels freer.

388
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,760
She feels freer.

389
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,960
Look at her. She's feeling good.

390
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,560
Not here. She doesn't feel well.

391
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm sick.

392
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,420
Please stop. I don't feel well. I'm sick.

393
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,360
Are you not feeling well?

394
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,380
It's the verb "to feel," to feel good or not good.

395
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,560
Now, Mireille feels good, she feels freer.

396
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
Yes, you can say that again.

397
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,800
Now, at university, I feel much freer.

398
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,260
I enjoy all the courses I take, especially the Greek art courses.

399
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,520
The teacher is a sweetheart.

400
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,240
He's a little sweetheart, he's cute.

401
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,200
He is as handsome as a god.

402
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,200
Like a Greek god, I suppose.

403
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,940
For the Greeks, the gods, in general, were beautiful.

404
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,360
Mireille's teacher is handsome, or at least she finds him handsome and witty.

405
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,460
He's very quick-witted, he's funny.

406
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,880
It's a delight to listen to him.

407
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,440
It's very pleasant, it's a treat.

408
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,220
It's a treat.

409
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,720
Okay, so now it's your turn to speak.

410
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,700
Look, what time is it?

411
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,820
Five past five or five fifteen?

412
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,420
Or 5:15 PM?

413
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,340
And here, it is 10:30.

414
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,940
Is this a large cafe or a small bistro?

415
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,440
A small bistro.

416
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,940
Look at Jean-Claude here. Did he fall?

417
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,060
No, but he almost fell.

418
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,380
Look at this man. What is he doing?

419
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,940
Does he do mathematics, music, or motorcycling?

420
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,200
No, he paints.

421
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,260
Robert didn't much like the European history course.

422
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,100
because there were too many kings and too much war.

423
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,400
We study history, we study geography,

424
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,720
We study Latin, we study Greek,

425
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,920
We do French, we do math, unfortunately.

426
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,580
We study natural sciences, naturally.

427
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,340
We do physics, we do chemistry,

428
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,360
to infinity.

429
00:26:52,260 --> 00:27:22,240
French subtitles?

430
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:49,260
...

431
00:27:52,260 --> 00:28:22,240
Subtitles ST' 501

432
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260
for humanity.
