00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Paris, the Luxembourg Gardens.

4
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,860
The Lilac Farm.

5
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,580
Two young people, a young girl and a young man, are talking about their studies.

6
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,960
He's handsome, he's handsome, he's so handsome. You can't imagine how handsome he is.

7
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,540
Who?

8
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,220
And the Greek art teacher, he has the head of Michelangelo's Moses.

9
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,920
I swear.

10
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,120
Oh really? Is it that old?

11
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,580
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

12
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,180
There's some on your skirt.

13
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,020
Add a little water, it will come off right away.

14
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,700
Oh, never mind, it doesn't matter.

15
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,760
It's not a big deal, it's nothing.

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,060
It's an old skirt, I almost never wear it.

17
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,080
There we go, here we go.

18
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,800
So, if I understand correctly, you enjoy your studies at university.

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,300
Ah yes, you know, after high school, in high school, you don't have a minute to yourself.

20
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,800
We are never at peace. We are not free.

21
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,960
There's always something to do. It's forced labor.

22
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,940
At university, it's more relaxed. We work, we work a lot if we want to,

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
But we're not forced. We do what we want.

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,800
In high school, I never had time to read for myself, for my own pleasure.

25
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,040
Now I can take the time to read.

26
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,560
Actually, these past few days I've been reading Hemingway.

27
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,460
Ah, Hemingway, mademoiselle.

28
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,820
He always positioned himself where you were.

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
Oh yes, really?

30
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,600
Yes, miss, at this very table

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,740
Impossible, is that true?

32
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,740
Yes, miss

33
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,080
Ah, what a man!

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,620
Did you know him?

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,500
No, miss, I'm too young

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,320
I've only been at the farm for a year.

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,360
But I was told that, miss

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,820
People who knew him

39
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,040
What a writer, what talent!

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
Have you read it?

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,040
No, miss, I don't have time.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,940
You know what it's like: work, family, garden.

43
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,080
I am not familiar with his work, but I have heard of it.

44
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,640
It seems he drank a lot.

45
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,140
Well, he was a genius writer.

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,820
Well, I'm not a writer and I'm not a genius,

47
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,000
But I think I'll drink it anyway.

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,160
The same, please.

49
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,900
Are you a student?

50
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,660
Yes.

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:21,860
Non.

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,320
Well, I was. I guess I'm still a student.

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,420
But right now, I'm not studying.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,000
I have just left university after two years of study.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,540
I decided to take a year off work.

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,660
Hey, you've taken some time off.

57
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,820
You take a year's vacation, just like that.

58
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,400
How convenient. What a great idea.

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,680
And why didn't I think of that?

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,040
Why did you take leave?

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,260
To find me.

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,100
To find you?

63
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,920
Poor little thing, you were lost.

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,300
Are you making fun of me?

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,920
Me, never. I never make fun of anyone.

66
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,120
But what do you mean when you say I want to find myself?

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,180
Well, I want to think about it.

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,960
I want to take stock.

69
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,600
I want to see where I stand.

70
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,920
I want to discover what I really want to do.

71
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,260
to know if I want to continue or do something else.

72
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,420
I see. In short, you'd had enough.

73
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,780
You didn't like studying.

74
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,480
No, that's not it at all.

75
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,660
I think we are taught too many useless things.

76
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
I find the teaching method far too authoritarian.

77
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,920
Far too top-down.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
I find that education is not adapted to modern life.

79
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,200
That's all. That's all.

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
But tell me, were you a good student?

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,520
Ah yes, not bad at all, very good.

82
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,920
I have always been a good student.

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,620
I always got good grades, I always passed all my exams.

84
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,440
I have never failed an exam. Never.

85
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,700
I am what you would call gifted.

86
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,600
My teachers even said I was gifted.

87
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,760
I learned to read almost entirely on my own.

88
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,700
No kidding. And to write as well.

89
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,840
Did you learn to write all by yourself?

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,060
Yes. And I've always been one of the best students in my class.

91
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,360
And you also received the prize for modesty.

92
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,200
There you go again, making fun of me.

93
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,840
Me? Not at all.

94
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,020
Never in my life. No, but I understand perfectly. You're just saying things as they are.

95
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,060
So today, Mireille and Robert are still on the terrace of the Closerie des Lilas.

96
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,500
They talk about their studies. Well, Mireille mostly talks about her Greek art teacher who is so handsome.

97
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,500
He's handsome, so handsome. He's handsome, but you can't imagine how handsome he is.

98
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,940
Robert pretends not to understand who she's talking about.

99
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,340
Who?

100
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,680
The Greek art teacher. He looks just like Michelangelo's Moses. I swear.

101
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,020
I swear to you, it's true. I swear it's true.

102
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,500
These are people who swear.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,860
In a court of law, you must swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

104
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Mireille says the Greek art teacher is very handsome.

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,480
He has a beautiful head. He has the head of Michelangelo's Moses.

106
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,940
He has the head of Michelangelo's Moses. I swear.

107
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
Oh yeah, he's that old.

108
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,380
Oh, Robert doesn't like that at all.

109
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,260
It annoys him. He thinks he's more handsome than Michelangelo's Moses.

110
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,000
What do you think?

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,180
Mireille thinks her teacher is very good.

112
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,540
Robert doesn't like that, so bam, he spills his drink on Mireille's skirt.

113
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,960
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry, there's some on your skirt.

114
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,240
Oh, never mind, it doesn't matter

115
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,320
It's not a big deal, it's nothing.

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,660
It's an old skirt, I almost never wear it

117
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,080
Robert s'excuse

118
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,160
Ah, excuse me, I'm sorry

119
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,860
We say "I'm sorry" to apologize.

120
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,060
But we also say "I'm sorry" when we disagree.

121
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,560
We agree, 250,000

122
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,620
No, Mr. Caladien, no, no, I'm sorry, but it's impossible.

123
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,180
Look here. The old professor apologizes.

124
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,320
Excuse me.

125
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,880
Here, Mireille apologizes.

126
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,640
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

127
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,940
I apologize.

128
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,540
Excuse me, I'm late. I had an appointment, so I couldn't do otherwise.

129
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,520
No, it's not a problem.

130
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,540
Excuse me, miss.

131
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,960
Excuse me for yesterday, but I had to take my little sister to her dance class.

132
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,860
Robert apologizes, but Mireille doesn't take it seriously.

134
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,040
It's not a big deal, it's nothing.

135
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,360
It's an old skirt, I almost never wear it

136
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,020
She never wears it?

137
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,620
Oh, what a liar!

138
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,340
Look, she wears it almost every day

139
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,820
Here, she's wondering which dress she's going to wear.

140
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,160
Here, Marie-Laure puts on her socks

141
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,620
Here, she is wearing earrings

142
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,860
And here, she wants to wear her pink dress.

143
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,160
Mom, can I wear my pink dress to go play?

144
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
No, you look much better this way.

145
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,760
Oh, I want to wear my pink dress

146
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,080
Infinitive, to put

147
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,620
Present tense: I put, you put, he/she/it puts, we put, you (plural) put, he/she/it puts

148
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:27,220
To allow, I allow, you allow, he/she/it allows, we allow, you (plural) allow, he/she/it allows

149
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,100
Past tense, I put, I allowed

150
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,280
Robert spilled his kir on Mireille's skirt.

151
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,240
Then the boy rushes off

152
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,460
Add a little water, it'll come off right away

153
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,060
With a little water, it will come off

154
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,940
Look at Marie-Laure, she's covered in jam

155
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,720
But it's going to start

156
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,220
Here we go, it's started!

157
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,380
Mireille protests

158
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,780
She doesn't want the boy to bother

159
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,340
Don't bother, it's not worth it.

160
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,540
Now it's your turn.

161
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,860
You are Mireille

162
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,700
Imagine Robert spilling his leather on your skirt

163
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,080
What are you saying?

164
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,060
It's not a big deal, it's nothing.

165
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,380
The boy rushes off

166
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,660
Add a little water, it'll come off right away

167
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,200
What are you saying?

168
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,060
Don't bother, it's not worth it.

169
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,500
Robert resumes the conversation

170
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,480
So if I understand correctly, you enjoy your studies at university?

171
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,240
Yes, Mireille prefers being at university to being in high school

172
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,720
In high school, there's too much work, we're not free

173
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
It's like forced labor.

174
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,340
We are always forced to work.

175
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,260
You are being forced to work.

176
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,800
Look at Mireille here.

177
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,520
Come on, eat Marie-Laure.

178
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,200
Don't force yourself if you're not hungry.

179
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,140
She wants to force Marie-Laure to eat.

180
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,640
But here, she doesn't force her.

181
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,680
She lets her go.

182
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,940
Do you want to come with me to Luxembourg?

183
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,300
I don't know.

184
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,800
Okay, do as you wish.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,780
You are not forced.

186
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,100
She is being forced.

187
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,820
In high school, you're always forced to work.

188
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,860
But at university, it's more relaxed.

189
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,220
We are not forced to work if we don't want to.

190
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,000
Now Mireille can read if she wants to.

191
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,860
But she is not forced.

192
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,960
She can read for pleasure.

193
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,920
Look at Marie-Laure here.

194
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,260
Does she read for pleasure? No.

195
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,160
Here, yes, she reads for pleasure.

196
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,780
Now Mireille can read for pleasure.

197
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,380
Actually, these past few days I've been reading Hemingway.

198
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:36,240
You know Hemingway, he's a writer, an American writer, he was a writer, he wrote

199
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Mireille also writes, but she's not a writer yet. Marie-Laure also writes, but she isn't.

200
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,900
Robert wasn't a writer, not yet. Hemingway also wrote, but he wasn't a writer.

201
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:59,580
A writer, a great writer, a talented writer. What a writer, what talent! He had...

202
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,840
Genius. He was a genius writer. The boy didn't read Hemingway. He didn't read his work. He

203
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:14,320
He hasn't read his books. He doesn't know his work. But he's heard about it. He's heard

204
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,900
hear.

205
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,280
Hemingway, you know him?

206
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,660
Yes, of course I know him. He was a great writer.

207
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,520
Listen, can you hear?

208
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,900
Yes, Hemingway is very good.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,240
Did you hear that?

210
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,800
I heard about it. I heard

211
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,240
someone who was talking about Hemingway.

212
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,700
I can say that I have

213
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,600
I've heard of Hemingway.

214
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,500
And Lacan, do you know him?

215
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,800
Have you heard about it?

216
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,800
Marie-Laure, however, has none.

217
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,140
Never heard of it.

218
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,640
Who is this Lacan?

219
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,780
A psychoanalyst

220
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,300
I've never heard of it.

221
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,460
It's the verb "to hear".

222
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,280
I hear, you hear, he hears, we hear, you (plural) hear, they hear

223
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,520
What is that noise we hear?

224
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,600
Waiting, I'm waiting

225
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,660
Hear

226
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,480
To wait for

227
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:22,360
These people are waiting, Robert is waiting here, Mireille is waiting, and there she hears something, Marie

228
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:34,980
Laure hears her mother and here the teacher waits, waits (present tense: I wait; past tense: I have waited)

229
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:44,640
to hear present I hear past perfect I heard the boy did not read Emingway but he

230
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:53,160
I've heard of him; I don't know his work, but I've heard of him, apparently.

231
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,300
They say he drank a lot, they say Emingway drank a lot, look at Mireille and Robert here, they

232
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,820
They are drinking kir.

233
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,220
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's drinking.

234
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,200
She drinks an Orangina. She doesn't drink alcohol.

235
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,760
I drink Orangina.

236
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,680
No, you know, young people don't drink alcohol anymore.

237
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,120
They drink water.

238
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,380
But there are people who drink alcohol, cognac, rum, wine.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,120
Hemingway, on the other hand, drank alcohol, whiskey, wine.

240
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,760
Mr. Courtois also drinks quite a bit.

241
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,640
And they, they drank a little

242
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,760
I drink, you drink, they drink, we drink, you (plural) drink

243
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,300
In the imperfect tense, we drank, they drank, etc.

244
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,520
And in the past tense, he drank, you drank, etc.

245
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,800
Robert drank a Kia

246
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,340
And now he's going to drink a second one

247
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:03,760
Well, I'm not a writer and I'm not a genius, but I think I'll still drink the same thing, please.

248
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,260
And Mireille resumes the conversation.

249
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,700
Are you a student?

250
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,240
Robert hesitates.

251
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:21,920
Yes. No. Well, I used to be. I suppose I'm still a student, but right now, I'm not studying.

252
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,480
I have just left university after two years of study.

253
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,940
He is no longer at university because he left university.

254
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,740
Here is a young man leaving university.

255
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,560
He's leaving, he's going away.

256
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,320
You can leave university, you can leave your friends.

257
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,500
Robert left university.

258
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
He went on vacation, he took a leave of absence.

259
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,420
I decided to take a year off work.

260
00:14:49,420 --> 00:15:02,540
"Look at these people. Are they on vacation? No, they're not on vacation. They're working. And these people, are they working? No, they're on vacation."

261
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,800
"Observe Mr. Bello and Hubert."

262
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,900
"Hello, sir. I didn't expect to find you here. Are you ill?"

263
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,300
"No, I simply took a day off."

264
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:20,760
Ah, look at Mireille here. Is she working? Is she going to university? Is she studying? No, she's sick. She's on sick leave.

265
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:33,200
And Robert, is he on sick leave? No, no, no, no, no. He's not sick. He just took leave. An idea. It's a good idea, isn't it?

266
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,540
Hey, you've taken a leave of absence. You're taking a year off, just like that. How convenient. What a great idea.

267
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,720
That's a good idea. It's convenient. It's easy.

268
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,440
Look at Marie-Laure. She's carrying everything in her arms like that. It's not easy.

269
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,860
But with a tray, it's easier. It's more convenient.

270
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,400
Take a tray, it's more convenient.

271
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,100
Hold.

272
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,100
Yes, that's true, it's more convenient.

273
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,320
Okay, so Robert has taken leave.

274
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,540
He took leave of absence on his own, all by himself.

275
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,680
To put, to get into.

276
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,660
Look at Marie-Laure here.

277
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,260
She sets the table, she puts the glasses on the table,

278
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,320
But she doesn't know where to put the knife.

279
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,520
The knife on the right and the fork on the left.

280
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
She doesn't know where to put herself here.

281
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,780
Where do I put myself?

282
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,800
You, you're going to sit there, next to Dad.

283
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,420
Here, they sit down at a table.

284
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,080
And here, where is Robert going to put himself?

285
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,140
In front or behind?

286
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,800
Stand in front.

287
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,340
No, I prefer to sit behind.

288
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,960
He was there, and he positioned himself behind.

289
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,300
Past tense, he went on leave.

290
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,680
He took a leave of absence, he left university to find himself.

291
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,140
To find himself, Robert.

292
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Why did you take leave?

293
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
To find me.

294
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,800
To find you? Poor little thing, you were lost.

295
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Look, he's lost. He doesn't know where he is.

296
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's lost her Asterix.

297
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Now she has found it.

298
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Hey, where are my glasses?

299
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:40,660
I can't find my glasses! I've lost my glasses! Oh no, no, no, no, no, there they are!

300
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:49,320
I found them. You can lose your glasses, you can lose a book, you can lose a button.

301
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,020
You lost a button, yes, but I have it in my pocket. When Robert said he took leave to...

302
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:03,200
Mireille found him, mocking him, poor little thing, you were lost, you're mocking me, me never

303
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,640
I never lack for anyone, that's not true. Mireille is mocking, she likes to make fun of people.

304
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,120
People Marie Laure is also mocking; she makes fun of Uncle Guillaume when he jumps rope.

305
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,480
Mireille is mocking Robert, but what do you mean when you say "I want to..."

306
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:34,460
to find, well, I want to think, I want to take stock, I want to see where I stand, Robert wants

307
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:43,880
think, look at Rodin's Thinker, he's thinking, he's reflecting, look at Mireille there, she

308
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:52,360
Robert thinks, wanting to know where he stands. He doesn't know where he stands; he's a little lost.

309
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
Look at Aunt Georgette here.

310
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,560
She no longer knows where she stands.

311
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,980
So many Georgettes!

312
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,420
Oh, attends, attends, attends.

313
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,340
Oh, I don't know where I stand anymore.

314
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,560
Now it's Marie-Laure who doesn't know where she stands anymore.

315
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,140
Marie-Laure!

316
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,720
Come here!

317
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,860
Yes, one minute!

318
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,820
Oh, I don't know where I am now.

319
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
Robert wants to know where he stands.

320
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,140
He wants to take stock.

321
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,900
When you want to know where you are on a boat, you need to take a bearing.

322
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,880
Here is a sailor, a naval officer, taking stock.

323
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,500
Look at this drawing by Dubou. The train is lost.

324
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,600
The driver takes stock of his position to determine where he is.

325
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,440
Mireille thinks Robert left university because he'd had enough.

326
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,420
Because it bored him. Because he didn't like it.

327
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,780
In short, you'd had enough. You didn't like studying.

328
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,920
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's eating too much candy.

329
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,000
Mireille thinks she's had enough, that it's time to stop.

330
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,720
No, you've had enough.

331
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,680
Here, Marie-Laure is bothering Mireille. Mireille has had enough.

332
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,000
Stop, I've had enough.

333
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,400
Robert criticizes the teaching.

334
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,800
He thinks that many useless things are taught.

335
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:33,220
He finds that the teaching is not adapted to modern life. It's not adapted. Look. This, this, yes, that's adapted, it's well adapted, yes. But this, this, no. This, this, that's not adapted. That won't do.

336
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,000
Look at that

337
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,660
That, that's suitable

338
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,480
It's well suited, it adapts

339
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,100
But that, that's a poor fit

340
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,820
It's not, it's not, it's not well suited

341
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,160
Robert makes a lot of criticisms

342
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,600
First, too many useless things are taught.

343
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,140
Second, the teaching is too authoritarian.

344
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,180
Third, the teaching is directive.

345
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,260
Four, not suited to modern life

346
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,020
Mireille makes fun of him

347
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,880
That's all.

348
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,600
That's all, nothing more, that's all. You have no other criticisms, that's all. Observe, Marie-Laure.

349
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Just one

350
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:23,080
That's all, yes. Now observe Mireille's reaction, and next time, what would you like me to bring you?

351
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,440
A Walkman, a camera for making movies, and a bicycle—that's all.

352
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,180
Mireille thinks that Robert criticizes teaching because he was a bad student.

353
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,920
But tell me, were you a good student?

354
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:48,800
But Robert says that he was always a very good student, that he always passed all his exams, that he was very intelligent, very gifted, even gifted.

355
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:57,220
I've always been a good student. I've always gotten good grades. I've always passed all my exams. I've never failed an exam. Never.

356
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,400
I am what you would call gifted. My teachers even said I was gifted.

357
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,840
Were you a good student in high school?

358
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,500
Yes, a rather good student.

359
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,500
In primary school, I was a good student.

360
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,320
I've been a good student sometimes and a bad student sometimes too.

361
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,760
Robert passed all his exams. He never failed. He never missed an exam.

362
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,340
Observe Mireille and Catherine here.

363
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,440
Catherine passed her Italian exam, but Mireille failed it.

364
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,680
It's stuck.

365
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,700
Oh, I got it. I passed.

366
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,500
Formidable.

367
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,260
Oh darn, I'm stuck.

368
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,480
Robert is very strong.

369
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
A very good student.

370
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,440
Very intelligent.

371
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,840
He's talented.

372
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,220
He is even gifted.

373
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,060
Very, very, very, very, very strong.

374
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,620
What does he do? Does he work?

375
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,140
Ah yes, he's an artist.

376
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,680
He plays the guitar.

377
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,840
He is very talented and highly regarded.

378
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,980
Robert never failed an exam.

379
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,540
None. Not a single test.

380
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,180
The boy hadn't read a single book by Hemingway.

381
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,540
He hasn't read any of Hemingway's books.

382
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,140
Have you read many of Hemingway's books?

383
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,240
No, miss, none.

384
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,680
No books.

385
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,300
Now, observe Mrs. Bello.

386
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,120
She doesn't know where Marie-Laure's book is.

387
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,980
She has no idea.

388
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,100
Hey, do you know where my Asterix is?

389
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,080
No idea.

390
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,360
A book, no book. An idea, no idea.

391
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,760
Robert taught himself to read. Well, almost.

392
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,640
I learned to read almost entirely on my own.

393
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,860
No kidding. And to write as well?

394
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,160
Mireille doesn't believe him. She makes fun of him.

395
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,220
No kidding.

396
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,760
No kidding. Mireille is surprised.

397
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,300
You know, my sister speaks Italian, Russian, Japanese, Swedish.

398
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,880
No kidding.

399
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:02,240
No kidding. Robert is making fun of Marie-Laure. Mireille is making fun of Robert. She doesn't believe what he says.

400
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,400
No kidding. And to write too. You taught yourself to write?

401
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,660
Yes. And I've always been one of the best students in my class.

402
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,200
And you also received the prize for modesty.

403
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,240
Sometimes, in schools, prizes, usually books, are given to the best students.

404
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,580
A prize for French, a prize for mathematics, a prize for history.

405
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,980
Robert may have won many awards, but he certainly didn't win the award for modesty.

406
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,520
Because he's not very modest.

407
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,000
Modest, not modest.

408
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,240
Mireille makes fun of Robert because he is not very modest.

409
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,880
And you also received the prize for modesty.

410
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,680
There you go again, making fun of me.

411
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,200
Me? Not at all. Never in my life.

412
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,640
Mireille protests.

413
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,260
Oh no, I'm not making fun of you. Not at all. No, no, no, no, no. Never in my life.

414
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,920
Observe.

415
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,240
Can I borrow it?

416
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,160
Never in my life.

417
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,540
Hey, what are you doing? You're hiding a card.

418
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,180
Me? No, never in my life.

419
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,960
Okay, now consider this.

420
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,740
The boy is talking about Hemingway. Mireille asks.

421
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,100
Did you know him? Did you read him?

422
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,940
Did you know him? Did you read him? I didn't know him.

423
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,040
Now, let's see what you've learned. Let's take stock.

424
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,660
Listen, think, speak.

425
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,500
Imagine Robert spilling his leather jacket on your skirt.

426
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,520
He's sorry, he apologizes. What do you say?

427
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,360
What did you say?

428
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,340
It's not a big deal, it's nothing.

429
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,420
It's not a big deal, it's nothing.

430
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,300
Now the boy rushes to clean the skirt

431
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,780
What are you saying?

432
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
Don't bother

433
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,940
Don't bother

434
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,960
The boy tells you that Hemingway used to come every day to drink a kir at the table where you are sitting.

435
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,780
What are you saying?

436
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,180
You say

437
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,680
Impossible, is that true?

438
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,660
Or you say

439
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,840
No kidding

440
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,360
You are asked if you knew Napoleon

441
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,060
What are you saying?

442
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,700
You say no

443
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,540
But I've heard about it.

444
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,700
Robert says you're making fun of him.

445
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,700
What is your answer?

446
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,580
You answer...

447
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,740
Me? Not at all. Never in my life.

448
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,900
Okay, let's see where we stand.

449
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,540
Let's take stock.

450
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,260
Yes, that's it. What a great idea.

451
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,660
Let's take stock. I love taking stock.

452
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,400
I like to know where I stand.

453
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,560
Oh, and we're not going to do any review at all.

454
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,260
Never in my life. No, but seriously.

455
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,960
I have other things to do.

456
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,380
And besides, I've had enough. Come on, come on, let's stop it.

457
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,260
No, but to take stock?

458
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,940
Take stock? Me, I'm going to take a nap, yes.

459
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:34,960
