1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and to participate in it.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very soon, you will see what happens

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and you will be able to say a few things

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
in French yourself.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In a café, Biré and Robert are talking

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
from the various theaters of Paris.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hubert and Jean-Pierre appear by coincidence,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
invite themselves to sit down

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and contribute their strong opinions

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to the discussion.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And here is this strange man in black

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
who wakes up in a strange way.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:19,940
Oh, what a beautiful spring day!

15
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,020
Yes, what a beautiful blue sky!

16
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,360
Yes, the flowers, the little birds, the Luxembourg Gardens,

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,360
the Champs-Élysées, the café terraces.

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,800
All of that is very good,

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,380
But I really should go to the theatre one of these days.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,060
Yes, you should go to the theatre one of these days.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,580
I'll have to go to the theatre one of these days.

22
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,520
You need to tell me what I should go see.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,660
I bought the official show guide this morning.

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,880
It's amazing how many theatres there are in Paris.

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,700
I think there must be about forty of them.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,420
Not to mention about twenty suburban theatres, plus all the café-theatres.

27
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,340
Note that many are tiny.

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,740
At the Théâtre de Poche-Montparnasse, for example, or at the Théâtre de La Huchette,

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,300
I don't believe there are 100 places.

30
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,520
So what do you advise me to do?

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,220
I don't know.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,440
You could start with subsidized venues.

33
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,240
What is this?

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,020
National theatres, those that receive state subsidies.

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,220
Like French comedy, for example.

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,360
Ah yes, French comedy, I've heard a lot about it.

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,600
Is this okay?

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
Is it worth going?

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,920
Yes, that's very good.

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,560
Obviously, you can't call it avant-garde theatre.

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,340
No, they mostly play pieces from the classical repertoire.

42
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,480
Molière, Racine, La Biche, Claudel.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,400
But it's still very well done.

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,420
And the staging is always very polished.

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,940
It's a high-quality show.

46
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,360
You get what you pay for.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,580
And apart from that, what do you advise me to do?

48
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,720
I don't know, it depends on what you like.

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
There are all kinds.

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,620
You have experimental theatre, avant-garde theatre

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,920
Pieces from Arabal, from Obaldia

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,640
Productions by Chéreau, Vitesse, Nouchkine

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,540
And then you have the traditional pieces

54
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,300
The well-made theatre, Allouille, Françoise Dorin

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,640
And then there's Boulevard theatre

56
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
Ultra-light comedies, with stories of threesomes

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,080
But I don't think you want to see that.

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,340
It's not very deep.

59
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,160
It shouldn't make you think too much.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,120
What made you think I wanted to think about theatre?

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,740
Oh, well then, go to the Folies Bergère or the Lido.

62
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,780
There, you won't need to think much.

63
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,100
Housework won't tire you out too much.

64
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,920
But I doubt it's worth it.

65
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,700
Do you want another genie?

66
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,460
I think I'll have another beer.

67
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,280
Hey, look who we know.

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,860
Yes, that's him.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,800
It's Hubert himself. How strange, how curious.

70
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,880
And what a coincidence!

71
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
Mireille !

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,880
Hubert !

73
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
What? You at Fouquet's?

74
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,520
But what are you doing here?

75
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,760
I was just passing by, but I didn't expect to see you.

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,840
What a happy coincidence! I'm happy to see you.

77
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,740
And Hubert settles in with a lot of blood.

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,540
There is a free table next to them.

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,980
A young man comes and sits down.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,440
They stare intently at Mireille.

81
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,140
But, miss, miss, we know each other.

82
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,980
We didn't chat together in Luxembourg a few days ago.

83
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,620
Yes, yes, you are wearing a lovely red skirt.

84
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
Ah yes, that's quite possible. Chance plays such a large role.

85
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,160
I was wearing a red skirt.

86
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,080
How curious, how bizarre. And what a coincidence.

87
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, if you don't mind?

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,480
He invites himself with just as much awkwardness as Hubert.

89
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,420
But you two are now inseparable.

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,360
With a guide like Mireille, you will soon know France inside and out, my dear friend.

91
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,480
But I certainly hope so.

92
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
And what are your impressions?

93
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,080
Excellent so far, but I don't know much yet.

94
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,100
Mireille just introduced me to love in the afternoon.

95
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,980
Ah good ?

96
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,680
Do you know it? Do you like it? It's not bad.

97
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,320
I must say that overall, I quite like France.

98
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,440
Overall, I only have very minor reservations.

99
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,460
For example, I am completely against tipping ushers in cinemas.

100
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,360
Oh, I couldn't agree with you more, sir.

101
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,040
Tipping is a disgrace to our country.

102
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,860
You know, it's the same everywhere.

103
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,180
No, but he's right.

104
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,740
These ushers only serve to bother people.

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,480
They always have a knack for blinding you with their torch at the most pathetic moment.

106
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,360
These poor women have to earn a living, it's not that bad.

107
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,240
Not so serious, but it's a matter of human dignity.

108
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,120
Tipping degrades both men and women.

109
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,900
It creates a slave mentality.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,560
Would you be against slavery? I wouldn't have believed it.

111
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,200
And what do you think about advertising in movie theaters?

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,100
It's a disgrace, a scandal.

113
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,040
They are taking advantage of the public's passivity.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,180
It's theft, it's rape.

115
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,820
Worse, it's a breach of trust.

116
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,980
Advertising only serves to create artificial needs.

117
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,500
And that is the triumph of lies.

118
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,680
The degradation of the human spirit.

119
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,820
Come on, Hubert, always with the big words.

120
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,280
You're exaggerating. There are some excellent advertisements.

121
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,000
Besides, nobody is complaining about it except you.

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,920
Well, that just proves how stupid the public is.

123
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,660
At that moment, a couple in love headed towards the table

124
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,640
that Jean-Pierre has left vacant and is going to move in.

125
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,360
when a man dressed all in black arrives, he pushes them aside

126
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,480
and sits in their place.

127
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,340
He pulls a follow-up number from his pocket

128
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,300
and pretends to be engrossed in reading the magazine.

129
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,180
In fact, he is listening to the young people's conversation

130
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,980
with sustained attention.

131
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,000
Who is it? Who is this mysterious character?

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,860
Will we ever know? Maybe not.

133
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,920
Life is full of mysteries.

134
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,120
It is only in fiction that mysteries are solved.

135
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,620
So, mystery and intrigue!

136
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,740
As Mario would say

137
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,440
Today, it's about theatre

138
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,520
Plays are performed on a stage

139
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,860
This is a scene from a play

140
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,620
Here, there are two characters on stage

141
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,020
They are on stage and they are performing a scene

142
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,380
That's a love scene.

143
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,960
That's a battle scene.

144
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,940
A tragic scene

145
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,980
That too is a tragic scene

146
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,220
That too

147
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,200
The scene here takes place in Greece.

148
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,780
The scene here takes place on the Orient Express.

149
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,460
The scene here takes place in a living room.

150
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,700
Here, the scene takes place in Luxembourg.

151
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,260
And here, the scene takes place on the Champs-Elysées, on the terrace of Fouquet

152
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,020
The two young leads, Mireille and Robert, are on stage

153
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,020
Mireille and Robert have the leading roles

154
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,660
These are the most important characters in the play

155
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,240
Robert wants to go to the theatre

156
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,500
He bought a copy of the official entertainment guide.

157
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,620
and he saw that there were many theatres in Paris.

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,940
It's amazing how many theatres there are in Paris.

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,280
There must be about forty of them, I think.

160
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,560
not to mention about twenty suburban theatres.

161
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,900
There are also café-theatres that present shows.

162
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,960
with two or three actors, mimes, and singers

163
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
like Philippe Garnier, for example.

164
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,300
Some theatres are very small.

165
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,320
At the Théâtre de Poche-Montparnasse, for example, or at the Théâtre de La Huchette, I don't believe there are 100 seats.

166
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,500
Robert doesn't know the theaters in Paris. He doesn't know where to go.

167
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,200
So, he asks Mireille for advice. He wants Mireille to advise him.

168
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,880
So, what do you advise me to do?

169
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,180
Robert wants advice. He wants advice about the theatre.

170
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,780
Here's someone who wants advice on divorce.

171
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:46,240
"We come to see our friends to find solutions and get advice, and then nothing. You could say I'm sad and I find it sad."

172
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,780
And here, it's Mireille who wants Colette to advise her.

173
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:57,760
"What do you advise? I think the other one suits you better."

174
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:08,900
Mireille advises Robert to start with subsidized venues, that is, national theaters that receive money, subsidies from the State.

175
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:18,340
The state subsidizes some theaters. The state subsidizes education. The state subsidizes medical care.

176
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,820
Have you seen the doctor?

177
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,660
Yes, I have to go back to the clinic tomorrow.

178
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,260
Yes, for two days.

179
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,540
Two days, wow, but that's going to cost you a fortune.

180
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,200
No, no, it's fine, it's subsidized.

181
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,020
The Comédie-Française is a subsidized theatre, a national theatre.

182
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,080
They perform plays from the classical repertoire, comedies by Molière,

183
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:50,580
tragedies by Racine, comedies by Labiche and Fédot,

184
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,700
more serious plays by Claudel.

185
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,700
This is not avant-garde theatre like Arabal, for example.

186
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,500
But the staging is always very polished.

187
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,880
It's well done, it's good work, it's neat.

188
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,360
That's not good work.

189
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
This assignment isn't very well done.

190
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,920
You should do it again.

191
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
That, too, is not a neat job.

192
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,880
Not that either.

193
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,960
But that, yes, that's meticulous work.

194
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,680
That too is meticulous work.

195
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
It's a very well-kept garden.

196
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,540
That too is very well done.

197
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,560
That too is well done.

198
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,900
They are reproductions, yes, but it's meticulous work.

199
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,620
They're real.

200
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,580
At that price, no, obviously not.

201
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:48,260
These are reproductions made in Taiwan, but very carefully done in the style of the Comédie-Française, as it is

202
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,720
In a subsidized theatre, there are seats that aren't expensive, and since the shows are

203
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,760
Very good, very well done, you get your money's worth. Look at this gentleman here, he doesn't get his money's worth.

204
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:09,340
Money, but here he gets his money's worth. Marie-Laure also got her money's worth. How much do you

205
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:16,240
You paid that much? 15 francs. Well, you got your money's worth. Is it good? Excellent.

206
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:23,980
Great. The shows at the Comédie-Française are very high quality. It's worth it.

207
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:30,520
It's not worth going there. It's worth it here. It's not worth it here. It's bad.

208
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:50,000
It's not worth it, it's a reproduction, don't cry, it's not

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,140
It's not worth crying, it's not worth it.

210
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,960
Seriously, it's not worth fighting for.

211
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,180
And you want to commit suicide for so little, it's not worth it.

212
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,680
Believe me.

213
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,840
But going to the Comédie-Française, yes, it's worth it.

214
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,080
Note that there is more than just French comedy.

215
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,740
There is also boulevard theatre, ultra-light comedies, a little bit risqué.

216
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,760
It's fun, but it's not very profound.

217
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,400
It doesn't make you think.

218
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,360
A swimming pool isn't deep.

219
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,820
A well is deep.

220
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
Sartre's Being and Nothingness is profound.

221
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,800
Plato, too, is profound.

222
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,100
Tintin is less profound.

223
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,900
Musical shows like those at the Folies Bergère or the Lido are not profound.

224
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,280
It doesn't make you think.

225
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,740
It doesn't tire out the households.

226
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,040
If you think a lot, it tires out households.

227
00:13:52,040 --> 00:14:00,640
63, 2, 65

228
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,120
Wow, you don't exactly go out of your way with the housework, do you?

229
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,660
Why bother cleaning houses when you have a calculator?

230
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,360
Hubert arrives, he is surprised to see Mireille at Fouquet's

231
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,740
How are you doing at Fouquet's?

232
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,400
He didn't expect to find Mireille at Fouquet's.

233
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,520
I wasn't expecting to see you

234
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,040
Mireille doesn't go to Fouquet's very often.

235
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,840
It's a bit too fancy and too expensive for a poor little student like her.

236
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,280
Hubert did not expect to see her.

237
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,600
And she didn't expect to see him.

238
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,960
The ushers expect to be tipped.

239
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,520
They expected us to give them a tip.

240
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,820
Parents expect us to say thank you.

241
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,980
Okay, what do we say?

242
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,620
THANKS.

243
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,700
Uncle Guillaume wasn't expecting that.

244
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,560
They don't have it anymore. They weren't expecting this.

245
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,280
You never know what to expect.

246
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,840
Hubert sits down at Robert and Mireille's table.

247
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,340
They settle in.

248
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,740
Ousmane settles down to work.

249
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,000
Here, Marie-Laure is sitting in front of the TV.

250
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,840
They too are sitting in front of the TV.

251
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,240
He settles down in front of the TV.

252
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,820
He sits down at a table.

253
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,920
And here's someone we invite to sit in the living room.

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,180
If you want to sit in the living room, I'll call him.

255
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,660
But no one invites Hubert to sit at that table.

256
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,760
He invites himself, very brazenly.

257
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,200
Hubert isn't embarrassed.

258
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,340
Mireille isn't embarrassed either, look.

259
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,380
Well, don't hold back.

260
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,160
Oh, how shameless!

261
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Come on, get out of here, give me back my seat.

262
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,960
A young man comes and sits down at the next table.

263
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,420
He looks intently at Mireille.

264
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,580
Look closely.

265
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,180
He stares intently.

266
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,380
He stares intently.

267
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,300
May I?

268
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,740
Jean-Pierre invites himself with as much passion as Hubert.

269
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,620
Indeed, who invited Jean-Pierre?

270
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,120
Nobody. He invites himself.

271
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,440
Who is opening the window?

272
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
No one. She opens.

273
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,300
Who is inviting Jean-Pierre?

274
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,560
Nobody. He invites himself.

275
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,640
Hubert notices that Mireille and Robert are always together.

276
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,480
They never leave each other's side.

277
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,080
But you two are now inseparable.

278
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,920
They are always together. They never leave each other's side.

279
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,380
They are inseparable.

280
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,440
But here, they part ways.

281
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,700
Here, Mireille leaves Aunt Georgette.

282
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,060
Here, she leaves her friends.

283
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,980
And here, she leaves Robert.

284
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,040
Excuse me, I'm off.

285
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,320
And here are some people who might break up.

286
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,620
Is it serious?

287
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,000
Jérôme, we're going to say goodbye.

288
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,620
Breaking up?

289
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,460
I can't stand this marriage anymore.

290
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:54,380
"But you two are inseparable now. With a guide like Mireille, you'll soon know France inside and out, my dear friend."

291
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:01,700
Mireille is a good guide. A guide. A guide. A mountain guide.

292
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,220
Now listen to the dialogue between Hubert and Robert, then you will play the role of Robert.

293
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:16,780
But you two are inseparable now. With a geek like Mireille, you'll soon know France inside and out, my dear friend.

294
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,700
But I certainly hope so.

295
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,700
And what are your impressions?

296
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,040
Excellent so far. Mireille has just introduced me to afternoon love.

297
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,040
Ah good ?

298
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,720
Do you know it? Do you like it? It's not bad.

299
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,320
To you, you are Robert.

300
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:41,500
"But you two are inseparable now. With a guide like Mireille, you'll soon know France inside and out, my dear friend."

301
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:48,600
"But I certainly hope so. But I certainly hope so. But I certainly hope so."

302
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,200
"And what are your impressions?"

303
00:18:50,200 --> 00:19:02,300
"Excellent so far. Mireille has just shown me what afternoon love is all about. Excellent so far. Mireille has just shown me what afternoon love is all about."

304
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:11,680
Excellent so far

305
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,920
Mireille just introduced me to afternoon love

306
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,800
Ah good ?

307
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,460
Do you know it? Do you like it? It's not bad.

308
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,820
Do you know it? Do you like it? It's not bad.

309
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:35,580
Do you know it? Do you like it? It's not bad.

310
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,540
Robert is all for love in the afternoon but against tipping ushers

311
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,980
And Hubert completely agrees.

312
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,900
Oh, I couldn't agree with you more, sir.

313
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:52,080
I agree, I completely agree, I couldn't agree more.

314
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,260
I couldn't agree with you more, sir.

315
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,660
Ushers are useless. They only serve to bother people.

316
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,280
They always have a knack for blinding you with their torch.

317
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,700
They have style.

318
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,040
Oh, look what you've done. You have a knack for arriving at the right time.

319
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:19,360
The ushers have a knack for blinding you. They're very good at it. They're specialists.

320
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,160
They blind you.

321
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,620
Here, the man is blind, but the dog is not blind.

322
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,100
The ushers blind you with their electric torch.

323
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,740
A torch.

324
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,800
A torch.

325
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,660
An electric torch.

326
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,300
They have electric torches.

327
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,580
He also has a flashlight.

328
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,520
She also has a flashlight.

329
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,880
Now, Robert is defending the ushers

330
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,780
They earn their living however they can.

331
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,760
These poor women have to earn a living, after all.

332
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,360
To earn a living, you have to work

333
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,540
She earns her living by driving buses

334
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,560
And she earns her living by driving a taxi

335
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,100
He earns his living by blowing glass

336
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,920
And she earns her living by doing people's hair

337
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,700
And she earns her living by singing.

338
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,280
And this lady's grandson earns his living playing the guitar

339
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,320
He earns a good living

340
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,840
Do you enjoy this job?

341
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,140
I do this to earn a living.

342
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,740
You shouldn't lose your life trying to earn it

343
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,100
Of course, you have to earn a living.

344
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,080
But Hubert is against tipping.

345
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,180
Tipping degrades men and women

346
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,520
Tipping is degrading, it degrades, according to Hubert.

347
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,280
It creates a slave mentality

348
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,960
According to Hubert, people who receive tips are like slaves who do not work freely

349
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,800
Like the slaves who built the pyramids, for example

350
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,840
Hubert is also against advertising in movie theaters

351
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,180
It's theft, rape, worse, it's a breach of trust.

352
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,140
It's a robbery, a robbery

353
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,160
Look

354
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,580
Here, miss, look there.

355
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,240
Look

356
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,800
That's a thief.

357
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,960
They are thieves too.

358
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:42,840
That's theft.

359
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,680
Observe.

360
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,680
They don't bother you there, especially.

361
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,800
That's theft.

362
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
These gumballs are mine.

363
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,920
And that's a breach of trust.

364
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,300
Close your eyes and open your mouth

365
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:06,680
You little brat, that's a breach of trust!

366
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,140
Bisque bisque rage, it serves you right

367
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,200
You will learn to steal my gumballs

368
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,400
There you have it, a theft, a breach of trust

369
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,060
It's theft, rape, worse, it's a breach of trust.

370
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,220
Advertising only serves to create artificial needs.

371
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,760
People don't really need to smoke

372
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,540
But they see a great advertisement for cigarettes

373
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,420
And they think they need cigarettes

374
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,640
It's not a real need

375
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,860
It's an artificial need

376
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,680
Hubert complains about advertising

377
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,860
He complains

378
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,320
Aunt Georgette is complaining

379
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,720
But what on earth is this?

380
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,600
Do they no longer do the dishes in this house?

381
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,260
She complains about her health.

382
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,220
Things aren't going well, I'm tired.

383
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,800
Marie-Laure is complaining.

384
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,820
My head hurts, my eyes hurt.

385
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,640
And Hubert is complaining about the advertising.

386
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,100
But he is the only one.

387
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,520
No one complains about the publicity except him.

388
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,920
No one is complaining about it except you.

389
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,820
Well, that just proves how stupid the public is.

390
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,140
The public is stupid.

391
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,380
Jean-Claude, you idiot, please.

392
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:18,060
A couple in love will sit down at the next table.

393
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,680
But a man in black arrives, pushes past them, and sits down at the table.

394
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,820
He jostles them

395
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,280
The old professor bumps into Aunt Georgette a little as he passes by

396
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,640
He also bumps into someone while running

397
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,200
Pardon

398
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,680
It doesn't matter

399
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,400
Asterix likes to shake things up a bit with the Romans.

400
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:49,980
Who is this mysterious character? I don't know, we don't know, we may never know.

401
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:59,480
It's never a mystery, an enigma; only in fiction are enigmas solved.

402
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,960
In fiction, in detective novels, mysteries are always solved; they are always solved.

403
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:16,960
The problem, but not in life. Okay, now listen, observe, think, and solve.

404
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:27,320
Look at this, is this neat work or shoddy work? This is neat work. And this, this is work

405
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:34,960
Neat? No, it's not neat. Look at this gentleman, why isn't he happy?

406
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,340
He didn't get his money's worth.

407
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,680
In your opinion, what is the deepest?

408
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,960
Tintin or Being and Nothingness?

409
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,900
Being and Nothingness.

410
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,440
Hubert sees Mireille at Fouquet's.

411
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,320
Why did he say...

412
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,500
What? At Fouquet's?

413
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,220
He didn't expect to see her there.

414
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,500
I wasn't expecting to see you.

415
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,960
What is Jean-Pierre doing?

416
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,080
They stare intently at Mireille.

417
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,960
What are they doing?

418
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,620
They part ways.

419
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,960
Why are the ushers annoying with their electric flashlights?

420
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,480
They blind you.

421
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,960
Why are they driving a bus? For fun?

422
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,560
No, to earn a living.

423
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,560
My head hurts, my eyes hurt

424
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
What is Marie-Laure doing?

425
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,340
She complains

426
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,040
That's all for today.

427
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,120
You can leave

428
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,320
Come on, come on, goodbye

429
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,040
But don't forget to follow
