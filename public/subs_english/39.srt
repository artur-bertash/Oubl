1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,540
Watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,100
Pretty soon you will figure out what's going on

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,380
and be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,260
Our four characters discuss theatrical forms,

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,300
stage versus film, immediacy versus permanence, etc.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,880
While the man in black sends signals in Morse code with his eyes,

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,300
Jean-Pierre argues the merits of the circus

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,160
and a strange nun replaces the strange man.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,360
The terrace of Fouquet

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,400
We hear snippets of a rather snobbish conversation.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Have you seen Godard's latest film? It's absolutely brilliant!

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,500
Do you think so?

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,580
Four young people are sitting at a table.

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,380
At the next table, a man dressed all in black is watching them intently.

16
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,580
Hey, did you see the eyes of the guy next to him?

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,420
So what, what's wrong with their eyes?

18
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,500
He has one eye that says "fuck" to the other, as if in the name of Victor.

19
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,660
No, no, it's both.

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,240
It's those two eyes that are saying "fuck off" to I don't know who.

21
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,580
How so ?

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,140
One morning.

23
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,140
What is this all about?

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,660
Yes, yes, look.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,180
He blinked one eye, that's a point.

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,280
He blinked with both eyes, that's a feature.

27
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,840
Line, line, dot.

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
Point, Z.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,920
Point, point, trait, U.

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
One point, T.

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,080
I thought he was flirting with Mireille, but no.

32
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,820
Not at all, it's a message.

33
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,620
Certainly.

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,580
Then he must be a dangerous spy.

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,820
Attention, he's listening to us. Let's resume the conversation as if nothing happened.

36
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,220
What is the future of theatre?

37
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,280
No good. The future is in cinema and television.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,500
That's wrong. Nothing can ever replace the presence of a live, flesh-and-blood actor.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,300
Hubert is right. Cinema is canned. It's mechanical.

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,460
Whereas in the theatre, the actor remains in contact with the audience.

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,820
In the theatre, a good actor constantly modifies his performance according to the audience's reaction.

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,580
Yes, but in theatre, the performance is ephemeral, whereas in cinema, it is fixed forever.

43
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,840
With film archives at Chaillot, Beaubourg, or with video,

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,740
You can see almost all the good films that have been made since cinema existed.

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,460
The Misanthrope, directed and performed by Molière, was surely brilliant, yes.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
But no one will ever be able to see him again.

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,680
And besides, cinema has so much more considerable resources than theatre.

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,500
In cinema, you can put 2000 fig trees in a Russian plain

49
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,740
With cannons, cavalry charges, an army lost in the snow

50
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,820
The army lost in the snow, I saw that in the theatre, in Huburoi

51
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,580
On a very small stage, there was simply a man

52
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,020
With a sign that read "Polish army marching into Ukraine"

53
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,160
Yes, but in cinema, it's easier to play with time and space.

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,060
All kinds of trickery are possible

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,420
You can turn a monster into a prince charming

56
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,580
Blow up the FM tower

57
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,580
Set fire to the Montparnasse tower.

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,580
And then in cinema, there is the possibility of dubbing in all languages.

59
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,580
Oh well, I can do without that. How awful! I hate dubbed films, there's nothing more fake.

60
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,580
I also prefer films in their original language, with subtitles for Japanese films.

61
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,580
Oh, because his Japanese is a bit rusty.

62
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,580
For me, only cinema, musicals, and the circus are of interest.

63
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,580
The circus.

64
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,580
You have very vulgar tastes.

65
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,580
Tell me about ballet, modern or classical dance.

66
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,580
But the music hall is for voyeurs who get their kicks.

67
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,580
watching naked women raising their legs.

68
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,580
No, not at all.

69
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,580
The music hall is the conservatory of contemporary culture.

70
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,580
And I'm not talking about music hall shows

71
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,580
like those at the Folies Bergère or the Concert Mayol, no.

72
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:43,960
I mean, the great recitals of my time or in the past after Brassens, at Bobineau, at the Olympia.

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,060
And also the cabaret and café-theatre shows of Raymond Devoz, Villeray, Coluche, Zouk.

74
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,880
Hey, the guy is still listening to us.

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,960
Wow, that's strange.

76
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,580
What, what is it?

77
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,600
He's no longer here.

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,640
In her place, there is a nun, all in black, who is reading the cross.

79
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,780
It looks like she's doing Morse code with her wimple.

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,280
Mireille and Robert are still on the terrace of Fouquet.

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,080
They talk about shows, cinema, and theatre.

82
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,340
But it's difficult to understand what they're saying.

83
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,180
You need to listen with sustained attention.

84
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,080
Because Fouquet is a large café on the Champs-Élysées.

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,420
There's a lot of traffic, a lot of people passing by, people talking nearby.

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,340
Have you seen Godard's latest film? It's absolutely brilliant!

87
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,340
Do you think so?

88
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,600
Wow, awesome!

89
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,900
They're great!

90
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,180
Jean-Pierre notices a strange man.

91
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,760
Hey, did you see the eyes of the guy next to him?

92
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,620
A guy, remember?

93
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,560
A guy with a black raincoat and a black hat.

94
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
He's a funny guy, you'll see.

95
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,280
Observe. A man, a guy, a dude.

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,240
Mantis, a guy, there!

97
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Did you see the eyes of the guy next to him?

98
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,040
So what, what's wrong with their eyes?

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,120
He has one eye that says "fuck" to the other, just like my uncle Victor.

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,740
Uncle Victor has one eye that says "fuck" to the other.

101
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,920
Her eyes disagree.

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,380
One of them tells the other to go to hell.

103
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,960
Look, here they agree, but here they no longer agree.

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,840
She's had enough. She says "oh damn" and goes off in another direction.

105
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,740
Oh shit!

106
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,300
So Uncle Victor has one eye that says "screw you" to the other.

107
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,020
He's cross-eyed, but the guy next to him doesn't have one eye that's saying "screw you" to the other, no, it's

108
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:12,640
Different from him, it's his eyes, his two eyes that say "darn" in Morse code, the Morse code.

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,660
You know how to send messages using Morse code with dots and...

110
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:25,040
lines, two lines, two dots, that's z, two dots, one line, that's u, and a line

111
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,220
It's T.

112
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,820
Listen to the dialogue between Hubert and Mireille

113
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,240
and then you will play the role of Hubert.

114
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,180
What is it?

115
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,040
Did you see the eyes of the guy next to him?

116
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,420
So what, what's wrong with their eyes?

117
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,660
He has one eye that says "fuck" to the other, as if in the name of Victor.

118
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,300
No, no, it's both.

119
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,000
It's those two eyes that are saying "fuck off" to who knows who.

120
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,360
How so ?

121
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,160
One morning.

122
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,160
What is this all about?

123
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,540
Now it's your turn. You are Hubert.

124
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,680
What is it?

125
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,720
Did you see the eyes of the guy next to him?

126
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,680
Did you see the eyes of the guy next to him?

127
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,480
Did you see the eyes of the guy next to him?

128
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,700
But what? What's wrong with their eyes?

129
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,000
He has one eye that says "fuck" to the other, as if in the name of Victor.

130
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,760
No, no, it's both.

131
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,440
It's those two eyes that are saying "fuck off" to who knows who.

132
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,280
No, no, it's both.

133
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,980
It's those two eyes that are saying "fuck off" to who knows who.

134
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:33,360
No, no, it's both.

135
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,060
It's those two eyes that are saying "fuck off" to who knows who.

136
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,640
How so ?

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,400
One morning.

138
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,320
One morning.

139
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,640
One morning.

140
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,960
The strange guy next to him is doing Morse code with his eyes.

141
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
He blinks one eye, that's a point.

142
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:04,480
He blinks both eyes, it's a line. He blinks. That's the verb "to blink." To blink, to flash, as in "blinking," remember?

143
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:15,220
Sometimes, we blink to get someone's attention. It's quite vulgar and not recommended.

144
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:45,200
"Look, he's winking to get a girl's attention. He's flirting with her. Let's see if you understand. Here, sir, you want to flirt with the young lady? Very well! But remember, in class, like that, to learn French, it's very good. But not in real life. It's too vulgar."

145
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,060
He must be a spy.

146
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,080
Definitely. So he must be a dangerous spy.

147
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,680
A spy.

148
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,180
A dangerous spy.

149
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,580
Mom, I saw a spy.

150
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,160
Then he must be a dangerous spy.

151
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Attention, he's listening to us. Let's resume the conversation as if nothing happened.

152
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,420
As if nothing had happened.

153
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,280
Look at Jean-Pierre here.

154
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,900
He tries to flirt with Mireille, but she doesn't pay attention to him.

155
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,500
She continues reading as if nothing had happened.

156
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,820
Jean-Pierre thinks that cinema and television will be very successful in the future.

157
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,220
She reads the future.

158
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,040
Jean-Pierre sees great development in cinema and television in the future.

159
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,440
The future lies in cinema and television.

160
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,300
The future is in cinema. The future is on television.

161
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,240
The road is ours.

162
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,400
The road is ours.

163
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,920
Paris is mine.

164
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,820
Paris belongs to Robert. And the future is in the movies.

165
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,960
The future lies in cinema and television.

166
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,860
Jean-Pierre thinks that cinema and television will replace theatre.

167
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,420
The motorcycle replaced the horse.

168
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:25,200
The train replaced the stagecoach. The airplane replaced the ocean liner. Robots may replace factory workers. But nothing will ever replace the presence of a live, flesh-and-blood actor.

169
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,320
The advantage of theatre is that the actor is alive, in flesh and blood.

170
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:40,660
It's not an image, it's bones, a bone, bones, it's bones and flesh

171
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,800
This isn't an image, a photograph; he is here, in the flesh.

172
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,200
Here's my little sister Marie-Laure, and here she is in the flesh!

173
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,140
In the theatre, the actor is alive. He is there, he is present.

174
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,560
He can observe the audience's reactions.

175
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:33,780
It's alive.

176
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,140
Whereas cinema is like canned food.

177
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,980
Do you remember? Like peas.

178
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,640
Do you prefer theatre or cinema?

179
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,860
I think I prefer cinema.

180
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,200
You have the music, the image, the text all at once.

181
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,880
For me, cinema is a complete art form.

182
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,440
I feel like I believe more in what's happening on the screen

183
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,240
than what is happening on stage.

184
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,080
One of the advantages of cinema is that we have great resources at our disposal.

185
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,340
You can do lots of things that are impossible in the theatre.

186
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,320
With special effects, you can make the Eiffel Tower explode or make it shine.

187
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,360
We can set fire to the Montparnasse Tower or the Eiffel Tower.

188
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,040
Beer steins can disappear.

189
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,680
You can make sauerkraut disappear.

190
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
You can make a cheese disappear.

191
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,920
You can take off from a plane on the Champs-Élysées.

192
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,120
Or we could make the Arc de Triomphe disappear.

193
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,840
We can put Mireille on Robert's hand, who is not very tall.

194
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,220
Or transforming a monster into a prince charming.

195
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,820
It's all a hoax.

196
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,920
In cinema, you can put 2000 extras in a Russian plain.

197
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,460
A plain of mountains, a plain.

198
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:24,180
You can put 2000 extras on a Russian plain with cannons, cavalry charges, an army lost in the snow.

199
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,240
The army lost in the snow, I saw that in the theatre, in Huburoi, on a very small stage.

200
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,240
There was simply a man with a sign that said "The Polish army is marching into Ukraine".

201
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,040
Mireille saw that in a play by Alfred Jarry, "Hubu Roi".

202
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,660
On a very small stage, the army lost in the snow was represented by a stick figure.

203
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,240
With a sign that read "The Polish army is marching into Ukraine."

204
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,720
And there you have it. No need for extras to represent the Polish army.

205
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,520
Here's an actor and here are some extras.

206
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,200
One actor, some extras.

207
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,440
And then in cinema, there is the possibility of dubbing in all languages.

208
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,920
A film can be dubbed into any language.

209
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,300
Mireille doesn't like dubbing.

210
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,020
I could do without that. How awful.

211
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,460
She could do without it.

212
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,740
Marie-Laure doesn't like lessons.

213
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,200
She could do without it.

214
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,560
But chocolates, no, they can't live without them.

215
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,180
Gumballs can't do without them either.

216
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,320
Mom, can I go buy some gumballs?

217
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,940
No, you're not going out at this hour.

218
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,160
Go do your homework

219
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,940
Oh, but I'm out of gumballs!

220
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,440
You'll do without it

221
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,420
I can't live without cinema.

222
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,400
I go there almost every day, I see 4 or 5 films a week

223
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,880
I love cinema, but could I do without it?

224
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,380
Mireille would do without dubbed films.

225
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,040
She hates it.

226
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,160
I hate dubbed films. There's nothing more fake.

227
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,220
She hates it because it's untrue.

228
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,320
That's not true. It's artificial.

229
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,960
Look at her hair. It's fake. It's artificial.

230
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,100
That's also wrong. That's not correct.

231
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,780
Damn, missed it!

232
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
Mireille doesn't like dubbed films.

233
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,200
She prefers films in their original version, with subtitles.

234
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,260
Jean-Pierre, what he loves is the circus.

235
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,020
The circus with clowns and animals.

236
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,820
The circus is what the Roman people loved.

237
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,560
Hubert finds it vulgar.

238
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,660
It's a show for the people.

239
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,700
The circus.

240
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,700
You have very vulgar tastes.

241
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,560
Tell me about ballet, modern or classical dance.

242
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,640
He doesn't like the circus, he likes dancing.

243
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,240
He doesn't have the same tastes as Jean-Pierre.

244
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,980
It's a matter of taste.

245
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,600
To each their own.

246
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,800
He doesn't like roses.

247
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,200
Roses? It's like blue hair in green, it's difficult to pull off.

248
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,360
You can't understand.

249
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,060
As for me, roses, well, to each their own.

250
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,160
Hubert doesn't like musical shows either.

251
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,840
Lido, the Folies Bergère.

252
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,580
It's for voyeurs who get their kicks from watching naked women raise their legs.

253
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,240
It's for voyeurs, people who like to see, to watch.

254
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,720
Voyeurs get their kicks from watching naked women.

255
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,820
They're having a blast.

256
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,280
They like it.

257
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,320
They like it.

258
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,180
Look at Marie-Laure here.

259
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,460
She's having a blast.

260
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,460
Are you enjoying yourself?

261
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,440
Yes, I'm having a blast.

262
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,860
They're having a blast over there.

263
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,380
Robert is having a great time.

264
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,280
He's having a great time too.

265
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,760
She's enjoying herself too.

266
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,140
She's enjoying herself too.

267
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,420
She's enjoying herself too.

268
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,580
They're having a blast too.

269
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,220
They're having a blast too.

270
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,820
She's enjoying herself too.

271
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,420
He's having a great time too.

272
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,680
Voyeurs get their kicks from watching naked women

273
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,760
Here is a man dressed

274
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,560
And here's a naked man

275
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,640
The lady with the unicorn is dressed

276
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,960
But the statue of truth is naked

277
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,780
The Statue of Liberty is dressed

278
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,760
But the Venus de Milo is naked

279
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,740
Bareheaded

280
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,600
Barefoot

281
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
Bare hands

282
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,240
And he's completely naked.

283
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,120
Jean-Pierre defends the musical.

284
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,320
Musical theatre is the conservatory of contemporary culture.

285
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,220
What he calls the conservatory of contemporary culture,

286
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,500
Obviously, these are not shows like the Lido or Folie Bergère, no, no.

287
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,180
But shows with songs,

288
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,160
like those of Jacques Brel, Georges Brassens, and Yves Montand.

289
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,400
Or perhaps shows where stories are told,

290
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,840
like those of Raymond Devos, Zouk, Coluche, Villerey.

291
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,020
While the four young people were talking,

292
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,460
The funny guy who used to do Morse code while blinking has disappeared

293
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:03,020
and was replaced by a nun who uses Morse code while wearing her wimple.

294
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,760
One can be bareheaded, or wear a hat, or a beret.

295
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,420
or a helmet, or a headdress, or a scarf, or horns, or a cornette, a hat.

296
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,260
What are you doing?

297
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,180
A beret.

298
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,140
A beret.

299
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,920
A headdress.

300
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,060
A headdress.

301
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,260
Headdresses.

302
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,960
A hat.

303
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,380
A cap.

304
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,940
A cap.

305
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,560
A hat.

306
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,780
A hat.

307
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,320
A cap.

308
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,520
A helmet.

309
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,860
A helmet.

310
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,880
A cap.

311
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,180
And this is a helmet.

312
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,720
Do you know this gentleman?

313
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Non ?

314
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,760
This is Fernand Reynaud, a songwriter

315
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,480
who played in music halls and café-theatres.

316
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,960
He was very well-known.

317
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,140
There you go, there you go, there you go, there you go.

318
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,740
He was very funny.

319
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,960
Everyone thought he was very funny.

320
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,860
Coluche also made people laugh a lot.

321
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,760
He mocked the average Frenchman, his prejudices, his tastes.

322
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,340
Spain is Spanish folklore.

323
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,200
I don't like it.

324
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,660
But to each their own.

325
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,360
For them, it's fantastic.

326
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,220
Did you understand? No?

327
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,860
Well, we'll ask him to do it again.

328
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,280
Spain is Spanish folklore.

329
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,120
I don't like it.

330
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,620
But to each their own.

331
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,560
For them, it's fantastic

332
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,200
This is Raymond Devos

333
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,980
I've played you, talk to me about love

334
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:57,620
Ladies and Gentlemen

335
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,100
I never dared tell you out of modesty.

336
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,920
But it's crazy how much I love you

337
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:15,820
I have lived only for you, and I am ready to die for you, right here, right now, on stage, if you wish.

338
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,140
Let's see if you understand it.

339
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:28,420
Ladies and gentlemen, I've never dared to tell you this out of modesty, but it's crazy how much I love you.

340
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,640
I have lived only for you

341
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,220
And I am ready to die for you.

342
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,900
Right now, on stage

343
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,380
If you wish

344
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,300
Hello, so

345
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,920
Hi, so

346
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,720
Ah, it's you, Mulray

347
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,600
You recognize me by now

348
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,260
Yeah, it's going well, really well, really well.

349
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,800
And you, huh?

350
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,000
Hello, sir, please tell me.

351
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,060
Would you happen to have a little help with spelling, please?

352
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,860
Actually, it's not for me, it's for a friend.

353
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,820
Finally, let's say, it's for her, without being for her.

354
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,140
It's for his kid.

355
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,860
So, you write anything, you know how kids are,

356
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,440
He won't even read it.

357
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,580
Ah, no, I don't have any paper.

358
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,200
Well, listen, you just have to mark it there.

359
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,200
And then I'll copy it. Okay, goodbye.

360
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,960
Ah, it's difficult, isn't it?

361
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,860
Okay, let's start again.

362
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,220
Hello Sir.

363
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,420
Please tell me,

364
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,460
Wouldn't you happen to have a little help with spelling, please?

365
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,280
Actually, it's not for me, it's for a friend.

366
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,260
Finally, let's say, it's for her, without being for her.

367
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,560
It's for his kid.

368
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,300
So, you write anything, you know how kids are,

369
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,860
He won't even read it.

370
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,020
Ah, no, I don't have any paper.

371
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,640
Well, listen, you just have to mark it there.

372
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,640
And then I'll copy it. Okay, goodbye.

373
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,680
This is Marcel Marceau, a mime.

374
00:23:43,680 --> 00:24:00,520
Okay, enough laughing.

375
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,560
Let's see if you've retained anything.

376
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,820
Observe, listen, reflect, and speak

377
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,680
Do you remember what that is?

378
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,060
A turn signal

379
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:31,640
And what's this gentleman doing? He's blinking. Is the year 2098 the past or the future? The future. That's a stagecoach. What did the train do?

380
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,600
It replaced the stagecoach.

381
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,240
Is that flesh or bones?

382
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,660
Les os.

383
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,640
And is that a bone or flesh?

384
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,100
Flesh.

385
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,920
In cinema, you can do all sorts of things.

386
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,960
Look at this.

387
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,640
Is the Arc de Triomphe really disappearing?

388
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,660
No, it's a... a... a... trick.

389
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,080
Is that a plain or a mountain?

390
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,140
A plain.

391
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,660
Normally, Japanese films are in Japanese.

392
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,660
If a Japanese film speaks French...

393
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,460
Damn, missed it!

394
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,600
That's because it's doubled.

395
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,160
If it's in the original version, if it's in Japanese,

396
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,660
To understand, Robert needs to...

397
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,220
subtitles.

398
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,640
To see clowns, acrobats, animals,

399
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,100
We need to go to the circus.

400
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,640
Hubert thinks the circus is a vulgar spectacle.

401
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,620
He prefers dancing.

402
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,000
Look at this young man.

403
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,640
Do you think he's bored or is he having a great time?

404
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,080
He's having a blast.

405
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,740
Does Mireille have something on her foot?

406
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,640
Or is she barefoot?

407
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,840
She is barefoot.

408
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,700
And here, is she wearing a hat or is her head bare?

409
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,660
She is bareheaded.

410
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,400
What do you think of Mireille's earrings?

411
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,400
They're great!

412
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,060
So, what do you think of our story, Ms. Folding?

413
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,060
Oh, that's absolutely brilliant!

414
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,780
You are so handsome, Mr. Robert!

415
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,740
Oh, what a charming prince!

416
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,260
Okay, okay, okay, that's enough, alright. Let's stop.

417
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,780
No, no, no, no, that's not it.

418
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,480
There you go.

419
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:24,720
