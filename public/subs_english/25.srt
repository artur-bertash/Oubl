Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,340
and absorb it.

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,740
Very soon, you will see what happens

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,220
and you will be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,280
It's morning.

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,460
Robert woke up and ordered lunch

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,360
and began to explore Paris.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,200
He visits an open-air market near his hotel,

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,180
then crosses paths with the same person at the right bank.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,040
He goes to a restaurant

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,020
where he is distracted by a scene

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,360
between a crazy customer and a weightless waiter.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,760
It is eight o'clock in the morning.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,020
Robert wakes up.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,540
It's Saturday, June 2nd.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,600
Robert gets up.

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,240
He looks out the window.

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,240
He stretches.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:46,400
He yawns, he takes a shower, he shaves, he cuts himself, he brushes his teeth, he brushes his hair, he cuts his nails and he orders his breakfast.

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,880
Hello, good morning, could I have some breakfast please?

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,940
Yes sir, tea, coffee or hot chocolate?

22
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,280
Oh no, no, excuse me, coffee. A latte, please.

23
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,780
Okay, sir, then a full latte, room 27.

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,600
Right away, sir, we'll bring it to you.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,920
He finishes getting dressed, there's a knock.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,160
Yes, right away.

27
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,540
Hello, sir. Enjoy your meal.

28
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,260
THANKS.

29
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,520
Robert is going to have lunch on the balcony.

30
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,760
He pours himself some coffee.

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,360
With milk.

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,300
Ah, where is the teaspoon? Ah, there it is.

33
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:09,000
There. A lump of sugar. He eats his croissant. Will he eat his bread too?

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,720
Well, it seems so. So, why not?

35
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,460
It looks good.

36
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,760
With butter and jam.

37
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
What? What is this? Mireille's jam?

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,440
Oh no, Mirabelle plum jam.

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:46,540
He takes his time. He's not in a hurry. He has nothing to do. He has leisure time. It's nice to have leisure time. He's going for a walk in Paris.

40
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:54,240
They pass by a bakery.

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,100
Ah, those croissants, those brioches, they look good.

42
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,340
But come on, Robert, you're not hungry, you just had lunch.

43
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:11,680
It's a series of errors, my dear.

44
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,560
A bastard.

45
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:59,300
Yes, it looks good, but come on Robert, you're not hungry, you just had lunch.

46
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,400
He continues his walk.

47
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,600
He passes by the Lutèce arenas

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:16,420
Then in front of the Paris Mosque

49
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,020
Saint-Louis Island

50
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,700
He walks, he walks, he begins to see

51
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,800
He buys a croque-monsieur

52
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,420
A croque-monsieur, please.

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,320
There you go, 9 francs.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh, yes, 500 francs.

55
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,600
You don't have any change?

56
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
No, I don't have any money at all.

57
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,400
Yes, absolutely.

58
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,880
Do you have 500 francs in change?

59
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,420
Yes, I think so.

60
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,180
50, 50-100, 200, 300, 400 and 500.

61
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,800
THANKS.

62
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:03,220
then he discovers the Place des Vosges

63
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,780
the old hotels of the Marais

64
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,420
the synagogue

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,640
and he eventually went into a small restaurant.

66
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,960
Is he still hungry?

67
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:44,480
Good morning, sir. Would you like an aperitif?

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,200
No, thank you.

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,780
Boy! Boy!

70
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,380
Go get me another glass.

71
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,100
This one is full of lipstick.

72
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,640
Boy! Boy!

73
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,600
Bring me a clean fork.

74
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,840
This one is full of egg yolk.

75
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:30,820
And change that plate, it's dirty.

76
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,760
But what on earth is this?

77
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,220
Do they no longer do the dishes in this house?

78
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,700
But that's incredible!

79
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,720
And look at this towel,

80
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,780
She is completely torn apart.

81
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,640
The tablecloth too.

82
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,180
You will bring me a calf's head.

83
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm sorry, madam. There aren't any left.

84
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,520
What? There's no more calf's head.

85
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,220
And what does that gentleman eat?

86
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,200
This is not calf's head.

87
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,160
That was the last one. There aren't any more in the kitchen.

88
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,560
But we have a very good pig's foot.

89
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,800
I don't want pig's feet. I want calf's head.

90
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,660
I'm sorry, madam.

91
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,700
The rabbit with mustard sauce is very good.

92
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,320
The mustard, the mustard, it's making my nose ache.

93
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,180
Okay. You will bring me a lamb chop.

94
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,180
Yes, madam. A lamb chop.

95
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,180
A lamb chop, a mutton chop, it doesn't matter to me, it's all the same.

96
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,180
And just right. Good, madam.

97
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,180
Boy! Boy!

98
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,180
You will bring that chop back to the kitchen.

99
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,180
It's not cooked. I told you it was done.

100
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
Look at that.

101
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
It's completely raw inside.

102
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,180
That's incredible.

103
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,180
And then, you will bring me another knife.

104
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
This one doesn't cut.

105
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,180
Here is your cutlet, madam.

106
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I hope that this time it will be cooked enough for you.

107
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,580
Your chop is cooked enough, but it's charred.

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,780
It's coal.

109
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,500
And bring me back those peas.

110
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,800
These are not fresh peas.

111
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,760
It's straight out of the can. It's canned.

112
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,780
That's all the cheese you have.

113
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,900
Your brie is too fresh.

114
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,180
Look at this. It looks like chalk.

115
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Your brie is too fresh and your camembert is too ripe.

116
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,180
It stinks, it's an infection.

117
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,180
And then, bring me some fresh bread.

118
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,180
This one was fresh eight days ago.

119
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Look. It's as hard as stone.

120
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm not a hothead, but there are limits.

121
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:24,280
Today, we have four main scenes

122
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,740
Robert gets up, Robert has his breakfast

123
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,700
Robert is walking through a market

124
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,340
And Robert sees a somewhat eccentric lady in a restaurant.

125
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,340
Okay, first, Robert wakes up.

126
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,820
He wakes her up.

127
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,300
She wakes up.

128
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,260
Robert gets up.

129
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,300
He washes himself.

130
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,160
Attention.

131
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,160
He gets up.

132
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,180
He washes himself.

133
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,520
He gets up.

134
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,300
And he washes himself.

135
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,760
Look closely now.

136
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:25,160
Is he getting up or washing himself? He's getting up. And here? He's washing himself. Good. He's washing himself. He's taking a shower. He's taking a shower. A shower. He's shaving. He's shaving. While shaving, he cuts himself.

137
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,440
He cuts his nails

138
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,900
He knows how to cut off fingers

139
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,740
He brushes his teeth

140
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,020
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

141
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,780
He brushes his hair

142
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,400
She brushes her hair

143
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,320
He wakes up

144
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,760
He gets up

145
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,340
He washes himself

146
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,100
He shaves

147
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,320
He cuts himself

148
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,180
These are all reflexive verbs.

149
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,980
Now, observe this.

150
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,700
He cuts his nails.

151
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,660
He brushes his teeth.

152
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,660
He brushes his hair.

153
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,000
Note the definite article.

154
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,700
Now, Robert is having his breakfast.

155
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
He has a choice between tea.

156
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,540
Here, have your tea, Dad.

157
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,700
Oh, breakfast.

158
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,380
Chocolate.

159
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,280
Or coffee.

160
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,940
He chose coffee, coffee with milk

161
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,860
He eats a croissant

162
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,880
And then he eats a piece of bread

163
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,660
With butter

164
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,440
And jam

165
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,560
Mireille's jam, what is that?

166
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,580
Mireille ?

167
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,120
Oh no, it's Mirabelle, Mirabelle jam.

168
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,880
This is Robert's breakfast.

169
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,340
What do you usually have for breakfast?

170
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,160
Croissants, coffee.

171
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,960
Black coffee?

172
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,880
No, coffee with milk.

173
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,140
Coffee, lots of coffee, nothing but coffee.

174
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,120
Are you eating something?

175
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,920
That's very rare.

176
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,980
Right now, I would have a yogurt, a piece of fruit and a piece of bread.

177
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,440
Luxury is breakfast in bed.

178
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,780
Here, have your tea, Dad.

179
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,920
Oh, breakfast.

180
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,460
After breakfast, Robert goes for a walk on Rue Mouffetard.

181
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,880
a small street that is very lively at market time.

182
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,540
There are lots of fruits, grapes, apples, raspberries,

183
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,360
cherries, strawberries.

184
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,960
There are lots of vegetables, white beans, green beans,

185
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,320
Mushrooms

186
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,020
Mushrooms are also a vegetable.

187
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,120
Tomatoes

188
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,740
Potatoes

189
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,420
Because there are apples that are fruits

190
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,600
And potatoes, which are vegetables

191
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,720
There are also salads.

192
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,780
There are all kinds of meat.

193
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,280
Beef

194
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,520
Mutton or lamb meat

195
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,360
Chops

196
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,400
Veal

197
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,040
calf's head, calf's feet, pig's feet.

198
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,660
In France, we eat beef, veal,

199
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,400
mutton or lamb meat, pork meat,

200
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,960
and also chicken, rabbit, and lots of fish.

201
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,760
And cheeses, camembert, brie, goat cheese,

202
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:53,920
Roquefort and Cantal cheese. In the evening, Robert goes into a restaurant for dinner.

203
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,840
He notices a customer who's always complaining. Do you know her?

204
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,100
You recognize her, it's Aunt Georgette, but Robert doesn't know her.

205
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,920
He grumbles because his glass isn't clean; it's full of lipstick.

206
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,920
Boy! Boy!

207
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,720
Go get me another glass. This one is full of lipstick.

208
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,920
Do you remember the glasses?

209
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,340
A glass. There is lipstick on Aunt Georgette's glass.

210
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,340
Lipstick everywhere.

211
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,160
She grumbles because her fork isn't clean.

212
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,500
It is full of egg yolk.

213
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,160
Boy! Boy!

214
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,840
Bring me a clean fork.

215
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,120
This one is full of egg yolk.

216
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,780
Look, see Marie-Laure here.

217
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,280
Wow, you're beautiful.

218
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
You're covered in jam.

219
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,620
Oh dear, you can't go work anywhere else.

220
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,620
Look at this. The table is full of books.

221
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Then Aunt Georgette grumbles because her plate is dirty.

222
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,620
And change that plate, it's dirty.

223
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,620
Pass me your plate, Aunt Georgette.

224
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:32,620
The glass is dirty, the fork is dirty, the plate is dirty, all the dishes are dirty.

225
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Why are the dishes dirty?

226
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,660
They don't wash the dishes in this restaurant anymore?

227
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,500
But what on earth is this? Don't they do the dishes in this house anymore?

228
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,120
But that's incredible!

229
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,820
The dishes need to be washed.

230
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,540
Yes, you always have to wash the dishes.

231
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,800
Aunt Georgette is also grumbling because the tablecloth and her napkin are torn.

232
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,420
And look at this towel, it's all torn.

233
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,980
The tablecloth too, oh!

234
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,220
There is a tablecloth on the table.

235
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,280
And then there's also a towel to dry yourself with.

236
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,980
But the tablecloth and napkin are torn.

237
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,480
Here, look at this sheet of paper.

238
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,080
Now it is not torn, but now I am tearing it.

239
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,720
It is torn. That's the verb "to tear".

240
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,100
Torn apart. Torn apart in front of me. I want to see everything.

241
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,060
Tear it open now. Come on, yes. Come on, again, again, again. Come on, yes, yes, yes, again, again.

242
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,700
Just a tiny little piece, just a tiny, tiny, tiny piece. Again, again. Come on, again, again.

243
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,040
He tears up a magazine.

244
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,860
Then Aunt Georgette grumbles because she wants calf's head and there isn't any left.

245
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,540
She wants calf's head. Calf's head.

246
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,180
Calf's head?

247
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,220
Yes, calf's head is good.

248
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,440
But there aren't any left.

249
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,760
There aren't any left in the kitchen.

250
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Aunt Georgette is starting to lose patience.

251
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,280
What? There's no more calf's head?

252
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,100
The boy offers a pig's foot.

253
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,020
Pig's feet are good.

254
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,500
Or perhaps rabbit.

255
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,220
Rabbit?

256
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,800
Yes, rabbit with mustard sauce.

257
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,220
Rabbit with a mustard sauce.

258
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,500
But Aunt Georgette doesn't want rabbit with mustard sauce.

259
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,300
She is losing patience

260
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,880
The mustard, the mustard, it's making my nose tingle.

261
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,040
She is not happy at all

262
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,060
It's going to explode

263
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,940
Look, Aunt Georgette here

264
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,880
He's really getting on his nerves.

265
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,800
Now look at Marie-Laure

266
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,680
He's going to get angry

267
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,460
Hey, give me back my gumballs!

268
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,740
What gumballs? I've never seen gumballs.

269
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,380
Come on, don't be silly, give me back my gumballs

270
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,920
Are there gumballs here?

271
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,220
Not possible

272
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,220
Come on, be serious

273
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,200
Now, look closely.

274
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,340
He's going to get angry

275
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,720
Ah, I'm getting really annoyed.

276
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,400
Give me back my gumballs

277
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,940
Do you hear? Give me back my gumballs!

278
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,240
Hey, what's wrong with you? Are you okay?

279
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,880
Give them back to me

280
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
Now it's your turn to speak.

281
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,840
You are Aunt Georgette

282
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,760
And you order calf's head

283
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm sorry, madam, there aren't any left.

284
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,540
What? There's no more calf's head.

285
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,220
And what does that gentleman eat?

286
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,200
This is not calf's head.

287
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,060
That was the last one, madam. There aren't any more in the kitchen.

288
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,480
But we have a very good pig's foot.

289
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,620
I don't want pig's feet. I want calf's head.

290
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,420
I'm sorry, madam.

291
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,440
The rabbit with mustard sauce is very good.

292
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,180
The mustard, the mustard, it's making my nose ache, isn't it?

293
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,100
Now it's your turn.

294
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,420
I'm sorry, madam. There's no more calf's head.

295
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,240
What? There's no more calf's head?

296
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,240
What? There's no more calf's head?

297
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
What? There's no more calf's head?

298
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,320
No, madam, I'm sorry.

299
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,440
And what does that gentleman eat?

300
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,140
This is not calf's head.

301
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,240
And what does that gentleman eat?

302
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,020
This is not calf's head.

303
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,860
And what does that gentleman eat?

304
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,580
Isn't that calf's head?

305
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,640
That was the last one. There aren't any more in the kitchen.

306
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,040
But we have a very good pig's foot.

307
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,360
I don't want pig's feet. I want calf's head.

308
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,720
I don't want pig's feet. I want calf's head.

309
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,460
I don't want pig's feet. I want calf's head.

310
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,580
I'm sorry, madam.

311
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,360
The rabbit with mustard sauce is very good.

312
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,460
The mustard, the mustard, it's making my nose tingle.

313
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,480
The mustard, the mustard, it's making my nose tingle.

314
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,840
The mustard, the mustard, it's making my nose tingle.

315
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,540
Aunt Georgette orders a mutton chop with points

316
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,960
She doesn't want a raw cutlet, of course.

317
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,440
She doesn't want a burnt chop either.

318
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,060
No, she wants a well-done chop

319
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,220
Not overcooked, but cooked through

320
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,240
Perfectly ripe, then.

321
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,620
Look at this chop

322
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,840
Is it ready?

323
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,040
No, it's charred.

324
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,720
It's coal

325
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,200
Coal

326
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,580
And then, Aunt Georgette grumbles

327
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,360
Because his knife doesn't cut

328
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,540
And then, you will bring me another knife

329
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,140
No, this one doesn't cut.

330
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,160
Aunt Georgette's knife doesn't cut.

331
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,620
But this one cuts well.

332
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,940
Then Aunt Georgette grumbles because the peas aren't fresh.

333
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,660
These are canned peas.

334
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,280
And then, bring me back those peas.

335
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,780
Those aren't fresh peas, they're canned.

336
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,060
It's straight out of the box.

337
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,640
There you go, fresh peas.

338
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,860
Those are canned peas.

339
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,560
A can of food.

340
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:30,560
And then, Aunt Georgette grumbles because the brie is too fresh and the camembert is too ripe.

341
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,760
Your brie is too fresh.

342
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,300
Look at this. It looks like chalk.

343
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,720
A good cheese should be slightly fresh.

344
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,300
When cheese is too fresh, it's not good.

345
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:55,940
It's hard. It's like chalk. Chalk. You know, chalk. Chalk is hard. It's hard. It's not good.

346
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,920
When cheese is overripe, it's not good either. It smells bad. It stinks.

347
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,960
Look. This Camembert is overripe. It's too old. It smells bad. It's overripe.

348
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,240
The Camembert is overripe and the bread isn't fresh.

349
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,180
It is as hard as stone

350
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,940
And then, bring me some fresh bread

351
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,760
This one was fresh eight days ago

352
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,880
Look, it's as hard as stone

353
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,820
It is hard, hard as stone

354
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,200
Stone is hard

355
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,580
Don Georgette is not a complainer, no, no, no

356
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,880
Normally, she doesn't complain

357
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,600
But now, now, she's forced to grumble.

358
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,080
There are too many reasons

359
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,660
When there are only one or two things wrong

360
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,420
Well, it's not a big deal.

361
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,060
But there are too many things that are wrong here.

362
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,920
That's too much, that's too much

363
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,860
This is beyond the limits

364
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,880
Look, see Marie-Laure here

365
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,740
She too is grumbling because she thinks she has too much work.

366
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,220
This is beyond the limits

367
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,940
I'm fed up, I'm sick and tired of homework and lessons

368
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,780
Hey, I think I'll go for a drive to Luxembourg

369
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,400
Just to change my perspective

370
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,260
Marie-Laure, you don't work?

371
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,620
That's a good one!

372
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,400
The mustard was making him go to his knees.

373
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
I had to complete a French assignment and a math assignment.

374
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,100
A history lesson, a geography lesson

375
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,580
And I don't work, there are limits

376
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,000
That's too much, there are limits.

377
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,400
Okay, now listen, watch, think, and speak.

378
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:55,120
Look at Robert. Is he getting up or washing himself? He's getting up. And here? He's washing himself. What does he have for breakfast? Tea, hot chocolate, or coffee with milk? Coffee with milk.

379
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,320
What is he eating here? A croissant or a piece of bread?

380
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,980
A piece of bread.

381
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,600
Where did he stop here? In front of a vegetable vendor or a fishmonger?

382
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,240
In front of a vegetable vendor.

383
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,240
And here, did he stop in front of a vegetable vendor or a fishmonger?

384
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,320
In front of a fishmonger.

385
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:35,880
And this? Is that a butcher or a fishmonger? A fishmonger. And this? Is that a delicatessen owner or a cheesemonger? A cheesemonger.

386
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,800
Look at this glass

387
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,540
Is it full of lipstick or egg yolk?

388
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,140
It's covered in lipstick

389
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,840
Now, be careful, this is getting very difficult.

390
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,000
Look closely

391
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,900
Is it rabbit with mustard sauce or calf's head?

392
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,580
You have to guess

393
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,900
What are you betting on?

394
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,300
Calf's head?

395
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,440
Yes, you're right, it's calf's head.

396
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,820
And in your opinion, is this cutlet raw, medium, or charred?

397
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,460
It's ready.

398
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,440
And is this cheese too fresh or too ripe?

399
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,960
It's overdone.

400
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,440
And is this bread stale or fresh?

401
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,560
It is as hard as stone.

402
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,720
That's all for today.

403
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,780
Give me a chicken, Mireille.

404
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,040
There's no more chicken Mireille, Mr. Guignol, it's over.

405
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,240
So, a calf's head.

406
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,380
There's none left in the kitchen, it's over.

407
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,060
A pig's foot.

408
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,400
There aren't any left.

409
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,600
A lamb chop.

410
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,500
No, I'm telling you, it's over.

411
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,700
Rabbit with mustard sauce.

412
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,220
Non.

413
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,420
Ah, the mustard, it's making me angry.

414
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,460
Here, the mustard.

415
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,620
Calm down, it's over.
