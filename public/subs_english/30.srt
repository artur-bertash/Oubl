Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,340
and absorb it.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,740
Very soon, you will see what happens

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,220
and you will be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,580
Mireille stops buying a car from her uncle

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,880
to visit her friend in Provence.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,220
When it's not going to start, the main garage gives him a lime.

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,020
which causes him all sorts of problems.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,920
In return, she tries to call Robert,

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,460
but he is still doing research

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,900
on the fine wines of Burgundy.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,280
Robert is lost in the middle of Burgundy.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,600
He conducts a systematic study of fine wines.

14
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,740
Beautiful dress, isn't it?

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He has a good nose for these things.

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,340
And meanwhile, where is Mireille?

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,760
Ah, that, I don't know.

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,300
She's going to get Uncle Guillaume's car.

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,260
She arrives at the garage like a flower.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
But the contact...

21
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,660
The car refuses to start.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,100
I think it's dead, it won't start.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,740
Ah, it's nothing my little miss, the accusations are flat, but don't worry about it.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,560
No, there's no need to worry about life.

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,720
I'm not worried about it.

26
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,980
What ?

27
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,000
What ?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,040
Yeah, she's dead.

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,460
The accusations are flat, but don't give us any more nonsense, I'll fix this.

30
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm going to lend you another car, a rental car that just came in.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,200
It's not very clean, but it will paint a picture of you.

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,900
That one starts right up.

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Oh, that's fine, thank you.

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,440
At the first red light, she presses the brake.

35
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,200
No effect.

36
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,180
She runs the red light and carries on like a flower.

37
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,860
Fortunately, there was a loan service.

38
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,000
She stops in front of a garage.

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,240
I have no brakes anymore, I was forced to run a red light.

40
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,220
Let's see. Open your hood.

41
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,940
That's what I thought. You don't have a drop of fluid left.

42
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,060
I've arranged that for you.

43
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,640
There you go, try your brake.

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,760
There, to see, pump, pump.

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,440
That works ?

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,040
Yes, it's fine.

47
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,400
Well, there you go, it's sorted.

48
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,780
It wasn't a big deal.

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,460
How much do I owe you?

50
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,260
For you, miss, it will be nothing.

51
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,840
I'm not going to charge you for that.

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,100
But yes, at least for the fluid.

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,580
It's nothing.

54
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,760
Well, goodbye, miss.

55
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,300
And be careful.

56
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,160
On the outskirts of Paris, at Porte des Lilas,

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,280
in the middle of a traffic jam,

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,820
The engine stalls.

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,360
Unable to restart.

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,540
Fortunately, two young people who were hitchhiking

61
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,460
they push her to a gas station.

62
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,340
Are you experiencing a breakdown?

63
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,800
Yes, but I don't know what it is, the engine has stopped.

64
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,660
Do you have any petrol?

65
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,880
Non.

66
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,280
That must be it. Shall I fill up your tank?

67
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,980
Yes, please.

68
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
Petrol or super?

69
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,800
I don't know. Great.

70
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:07,020
Check the levels.

71
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
Yes, I think that's better.

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,200
It's good.

73
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:22,840
THANKS.

74
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:34,100
And Mireille leaves, without the two hitchhikers who have just been picked up by a Swiss Mercedes.

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,060
A few kilometers from Provins, the front left tire punctured as it came out of a bend.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
And Mireille almost ended up in the ditch.

77
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,880
She's getting ready to change the tire, but the spare tire is flat.

78
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,220
A cyclist arrives.

79
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,620
Are you experiencing a breakdown?

80
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,220
I'm dead.

81
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,400
I will help you.

82
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,460
It's no use, my spare tire is flat.

83
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,620
Don't worry, I'll send you a repairman.

84
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,720
That's kind, thank you.

85
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,960
Mireille attend

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,200
by plucking the petals off daisies

87
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,460
on the side of the road

88
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,660
He likes me a little

89
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,860
a lot

90
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,480
passionately

91
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,940
madly

92
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,600
no way

93
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,280
He will arrive in an hour

94
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,220
in half an hour

95
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,340
in fifteen minutes

96
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:02,240
In five minutes, right away, not at all.

97
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,240
The breakdown service driver tows the car to the garage.

98
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
We repaired both tires.

99
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,020
And Mireille leaves again.

100
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,000
She hadn't gone 100 meters before it started to rain.

101
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,420
Obviously, the windshield wipers aren't working.

102
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,580
She is forced to drive in the rain, leaning out of the door.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,080
She arrives at the houses soaking wet.

104
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,940
What's wrong? Are you late?

105
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,000
You're completely soaked.

106
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,040
No one talks to me about it.

107
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,340
Between.

108
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,340
No, wait, I'm going to try my headlights first.

109
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
That works ?

110
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
Non.

111
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
Try again.

112
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
Non.

113
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,340
It doesn't work.

114
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,340
I suspected it, I was sure of it.

115
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,340
Okay, listen, I'm going back to make sure I arrive before nightfall.

116
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,340
Just as she arrives, Bordelila.

117
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:03,340
A cyclist skids in front of her, she swerves to avoid him, then puts on her indicator, but too late, she has hit another car.

118
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,340
The result: a dented wing and a scratch on the right border.

119
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Ah, what a day! Long live the train!

120
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,340
But you can't pay attention, can you!

121
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:35,220
Around 11 p.m., Mireille phoned the Latin man at the water's edge. The Latin man, Mr. Taylor, please...

122
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:46,880
Please, his room doesn't answer, are you sure his key is there? Okay, thank you.

123
00:09:46,880 --> 00:10:00,740
It's past 11 o'clock, but at the wellness center, I don't know where Robert is; he's in Burgundy.

124
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:13,280
He continues by singing about his study of the great wines of the region, and I am proud to be my lucky charm.

125
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,880
So today, Mireille is going to Provence by car and she has a whole bunch of problems.

126
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,960
First, she arrives at the garage. She arrives like a flower, confident, at ease, self-assured.

127
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,220
Look at Jean-Claude coming in. He's arriving confident.

128
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,160
Mireille arrives at the garage. She turns on the ignition.

129
00:10:41,980 --> 00:11:02,300
No effect. It doesn't work. The car won't start. She turns the key. He turns the key. Mireille turns the key, but the engine won't start because the batteries are dead.

130
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,900
the accumulators, the battery.

131
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,540
The battery is dead.

132
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,560
It is empty.

133
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,320
Look at the tire there. It's flat.

134
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,860
It is empty. There is no more air.

135
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,220
The batteries are dead.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,100
But the mechanic is optimistic.

137
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,620
He is like Mr. Courtois.

138
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,300
Ladies, the batteries are flat, don't worry about us.

139
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:44,540
Yeah, she's dead. The accusations are flying, but don't worry, I'll sort it out.

140
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,840
Do you remember, Mr. Courtois? He always says, oh, don't worry.

141
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,980
He means, don't worry.

142
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,580
He's worried sick.

143
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,380
Don't worry, don't fret.

144
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,300
Listen.

145
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,040
Hello ?

146
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,000
Listen, don't worry, I'm very careful.

147
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,180
Don't worry, Henri will sort everything out.

148
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,080
Don't worry, I'll send you a repairman.

149
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,780
The garage owner gives Mireille another car, a rental car.

150
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,920
It starts right away, it starts instantly.

151
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,420
A quarter turn, a half turn, a full turn, the car starts right away, at the first turn.

152
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,600
Mireille is reassured, she regains confidence

153
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,020
Everything is fine, life is beautiful, the road is mine, the road is ours

154
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,960
Look at Robert here, he too is very confident, very self-assured

155
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,500
Paris is mine

156
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,120
Mireille arrives at the first red light

157
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,500
When the light is red, you must stop.

158
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,580
Mireille presses the brake

159
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,880
But nothing happens

160
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,960
No effect

161
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,280
The car continues to move

162
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,780
She doesn't stop

163
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,820
No effect

164
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,200
Mireille presses the brake

165
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,940
But it has no effect

166
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,020
Here the lady presses the brake

167
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,160
And there is an effect

168
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
The car does not stop

169
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,700
Mireille goes through the red light

170
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
She ran the red light.

171
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,800
You must not run red lights.

172
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,460
The officers don't like it.

173
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,680
Why aren't the brakes working?

174
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,660
Because there is no more fluid in the brakes.

175
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,420
That's what I thought. You don't have a drop of fluid left.

176
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,520
I'll fix that.

177
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,040
There's no fluid left at all. Not a drop.

178
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,760
Do you remember? A drop.

179
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,060
You need to add brake fluid.

180
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,620
There you go, try your brake

181
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,900
There, to see, pump

182
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,020
pump

183
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,240
That works ?

184
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes, it's okay.

185
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,080
Now that the brakes are fixed

186
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,340
Mireille wants to pay

187
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,600
She asks how much she owes

188
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,000
How much do I owe you?

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,280
It's the verb "devoir" (to have to/must).

190
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,800
How much do I owe you?

191
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,600
How much do I owe you?

192
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,880
Come on, it's nothing

193
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,360
For you, miss, it will be nothing.

194
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,820
I'm not going to charge you for that.

195
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,760
It's the verb "to pay".

196
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,920
Look at Robert here. He's paying.

197
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,400
Robert straw.

198
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,400
Robert always pays.

199
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,700
But Mireille doesn't pay.

200
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,640
Psst, it's nothing.

201
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,740
Okay, goodbye and be careful.

202
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,700
Don't worry, I'm very careful.

203
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
Attention, attention, prudence.

204
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,620
We must be careful.

205
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,940
Oh, Mireille is cautious.

206
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,940
But she falls flat on her face.

207
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,320
Luckily, two hitchhikers in shorts, hairy and bearded, offered to give her a push.

208
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,880
You've broken down, we'll push you here. Robert pushes the

209
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:09,820
"Porte" is the verb "pousser" (to push). Why did Mireille break down?

210
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:15,820
This time, what is it? Gasoline? No, but that must be it.

211
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:24,640
I'm filling up, yes please, and it's super, I don't know, super, come on, super, it's more

212
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,160
Dear, it must be the best. I'll check the levels. Yes, I think it's better.

213
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,140
It's best to check the oil and water levels; the mechanic will check the levels.

214
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:44,140
The oil and water levels are good, that's good, the levels are correct, there's enough oil and enough water.

215
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:56,080
A few kilometers in the countryside, the front tire goes flat. Do you remember a tire...

216
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:08,140
tire, a front tire, the front, the rear, the front, the rear, the front left tire is flat, it's flat

217
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:32,040
It's flat. Look. I'm going to puncture the tire. There, that's it, it's flat. The front left tire is flat and Mireille almost ends up in the ditch. Look at this gentleman and this lady. Do they almost end up in the ditch? No. They end up in the ditch. They're in the ditch.

218
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Mireille, however, did not end up in the ditch.

219
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,820
But she almost ended up in the ditch.

220
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,760
Mireille has a flat tire and the spare tire is flat

221
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,940
Luckily, a cyclist passes by.

222
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,960
He offers to help her

223
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,700
I will help you

224
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,760
That's a shame, the spare tire is flat

225
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,260
Don't worry, I'll send you a repairman.

226
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:06,580
A repairman. When you have a breakdown, you call a repairman to help you out.

227
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,280
Listen to the conversation between the cyclist and Mireille.

228
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,460
Then, you will answer the cyclist as if you were Mireille.

229
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,140
Are you stranded? I have a flat tire. I'll help you.

230
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,200
It's no use, the emergency route is flat.

231
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,660
Don't worry. I'll send a repairman.

232
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,200
Ah yes, thank you.

233
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,860
Now answer the cyclists as if you were Mireille, you're broken down, I have a flat tire

234
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:43,740
I have a flat tire, I have a flat tire, but I'll help you. It's no use, the spare tire is flat.

235
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:52,500
It's no use, the spare tire is flat. It's no use, the spare tire.

236
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,180
It's flat. Don't worry, I'll send a repairman. Oh, that's kind, thank you. Oh, that's kind, thank you.

237
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,820
Oh, that's kind of you, thank you. When something's wrong, we call the repairman. The repairman is a bit like

238
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:16,040
Like the doctor. Look, check out this advertisement for a company that sells televisions.

239
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,600
It had to happen to us. And it's just a Sunday. That's just bad luck. Did you say so?

240
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,880
As long as it's not too much of a hassle.

241
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,600
I hope so, yes.

242
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,960
Enter.

243
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
SO ?

244
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,060
He's here.

245
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,040
Is it serious?

246
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,000
He thinks not.

247
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,680
Luckily he was able to come right away.

248
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,460
One phone call, and he arrived.

249
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,640
That's a good thing.

250
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,560
How are you?

251
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,160
Yes, it's fine.

252
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,220
Well, we should have suspected as much, he was very pale the last time we saw him.

253
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,180
It's funny, you have to say it's also gentler.

254
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,860
Anyway !

255
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,400
So, you can go see it.

256
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,620
Oh, you don't talk like Paul, do you!

257
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,240
Oh, that looks like a mess!

258
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,620
He's back to his old self, yeah!

259
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,760
You will begin.

260
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,920
Breakdown assistance, 7 days a week, is part of Arti's trust contract.

261
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,580
While waiting for the repairman, Mireille plucks the petals off daisies.

262
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,060
She's plucking the petals off daisies to pass the time.

263
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,560
Normally, it is lovers who pluck the petals off daisies to find out if the other loves them.

264
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,680
We say he loves me or she loves me, a little, a lot.

265
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,720
Let's ask this lady. She seems very romantic.

266
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,260
What do we say when we pluck the petals off a daisy?

267
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,580
We say, I love you a little, a lot, passionately, madly.

268
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:57,140
He loves me a little, a lot, passionately, madly, we don't know.

269
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:12,280
He will arrive in an hour, in half an hour, in a quarter of an hour, in five minutes, right away, almost at all.

270
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,860
Yes, yes, he's coming. And here he is.

271
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,140
The breakdown service crew took Mireille's car to the garage.

272
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,400
The tires are repaired. And Mireille sets off again.

273
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,700
We repair it. She's off again.

274
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,400
We repair, that's the verb to repair.

275
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,440
She leaves again, that's the verb to leave again.

276
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,520
Well, Mireille sets off again, but she hasn't gone 100 meters before it starts to rain.

277
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,980
It starts to rain.

278
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,900
It's starting to rain.

279
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,500
It's the verb "se mettre à".

280
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,580
Look at Marie-Laure here.

281
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,500
She wants to start watching television.

282
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
You're not going to start watching television.

283
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,740
Go do your homework.

284
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,520
It starts to rain and the windshield wipers don't work.

285
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,540
The windshield wipers are working.

286
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,120
The windshield wipers are not working.

287
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,460
Mireille can't see anything because of the rain

288
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,180
So she is forced to drive while leaning out of the door.

289
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,300
The door

290
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,480
A door

291
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,100
A door

292
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,680
A door

293
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,240
A door

294
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,980
A car door

295
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,860
A car door

296
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,900
A portal

297
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
A portal

298
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,460
A church portal

299
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,240
Obviously, when Mireille arrives, she is soaked.

300
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,660
She's completely wet.

301
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,460
What's wrong? Are you late?

302
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,800
Are you all soaked?

303
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,860
Look at Marie-Laure.

304
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,860
She too is soaked because she fell into the pool.

305
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:53,940
Soaked.

306
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,460
Mireille is testing the headlights.

307
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,260
They don't work.

308
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,200
They are testing the headlights.

309
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,860
A lighthouse.

310
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,260
Damn, it doesn't work. I suspected as much, I was sure of it.

311
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,580
I suspected as much. I knew it. That's exactly what I thought.

312
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,180
Now, look at Marie-Laure.

313
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,260
She suspected that Mireille had eaten all her chocolates.

314
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,180
She knew it. She had a premonition.

315
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,600
She suspected as much.

316
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,500
There aren't any left. I suspected as much.

317
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,260
You're the one who took them, aren't you, you little brat?

318
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,000
Hey, easy now!

319
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,680
When Mireille arrives in Paris, a cyclist skids in front of her.

320
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:44,120
The cyclist is skidding. There's a car skidding. A spectacular skid. Watch out, skidding danger.

321
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:56,720
Mireille wants to avoid the cyclist. To avoid him, she swerves and then puts on her turn signal. But she put her turn signal on too late.

322
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,300
She hit another car

323
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,380
A hook, hanging

324
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,340
A clash

325
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,280
She clipped a car

326
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,620
Balance sheet, total, result

327
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,040
A dented fender and a scratch on the door

328
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,960
One wing, one wing sunk

329
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,300
And a scratch on the right-hand door

330
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,920
A scratch

331
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,880
In the evening, Mireille calls Robert

332
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,660
The doorbell rings and rings, but her room doesn't answer.

333
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,240
His room is not responding

334
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,000
Are you sure? Is her key here?

335
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,740
Yes, ma'am, his key is here, he hasn't come in.

336
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,260
One key, several keys

337
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,560
A key, the ignition key

338
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,500
His key isn't there, so he must be in his room.

339
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,180
His key is there, so he's not in his room.

340
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,440
He went out and he didn't come back.

341
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,140
Eleven o'clock has passed, but in a state of mild well-being.

342
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,480
Well, he's in Burgundy.

343
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,820
He is currently tasting the great wines of Burgundy.

344
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,560
At Oxcorton, Nuit-Saint-Georges, Chevré-Chambertin...

345
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,400
I am proud to be from Burgundy, and I am proud, and I am proud...

346
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,560
Robert Bourguignon? Oh, what a joke!

347
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,420
Okay, let's see what you have to say.

348
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,900
Look, listen, think, and respond.

349
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,660
Why can't Mireille start the car?

350
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,560
What's flat? The batteries or the tires?

351
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,660
The accused.

352
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,980
What are Mireille and Colette checking here?

353
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,060
They are checking the headlights.

354
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,660
What should you do when you run out of petrol?

355
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,080
We need to fill up the tank.

356
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,660
Which is more expensive? Petrol or premium?

357
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,100
The super.

358
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,660
What is it? The front or the back of the car?

359
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,000
The front.

360
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
When you break down, who should you call?

361
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,160
The repairman.

362
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,000
When should you stop? At the red light or the green light?

363
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,480
At the red light.

364
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,340
You want to pay. What do you say?

365
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,000
How much do I owe you?

366
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,000
What does the mechanic do? Does he repair it or does he take it away?

367
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,200
He repairs it.

368
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,240
And what is Mireille doing?

369
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,460
She leaves again.

370
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,460
Mireille arrives at a red light. Her brakes are not working.

371
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,020
What is she doing?

372
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,360
She ran the red light.

373
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,420
Oh dear! Oh my God! There are no brakes!

374
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,480
Oh dear! I ran a red light! Oh my God!

375
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,480
So, Miss Mireille, is that how you run red lights?

376
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,060
It's not my fault, officer. I have no brakes.

377
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,540
And what about the handbrake? You don't have a handbrake either?

378
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,900
I have a handbrake, but it doesn't work.

379
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,020
Miss Mireille, you need to have brakes that work.

380
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,220
For what?

381
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,240
To stop, Miss Mireille.

382
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,560
To stop?

383
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,880
My dad, who works at Renaud, always says that cars are made to drive, not to stop.

384
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,560
Come on, come on, come on, no discussion, I'm stopping you.

385
00:26:42,540 --> 00:27:11,540
...

386
