00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,160
and fly away. Very soon you will see what happens and you will be

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,500
able to say a few words in French yourself. Hubert offers his little car and

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,840
himself for the trip around France. Colette decides to be the fourth.

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,220
Then Mireille invites another friend, the leftist Jean-Michel. After much

6
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,860
quick conversation, it allows everyone to accept what is promised to be a

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,260
a welcoming and persuasive quintet.

8
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,500
I don't see why I would get bored with him.

9
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,160
No, on the contrary, travelling in France with a foreigner,

10
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,840
to show him what we like,

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,040
That must be exciting.

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,520
And how do you plan to travel around France?

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,860
With a car that we will rent.

14
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,120
We will spend the nights sleeping,

15
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,140
under a tree,

16
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,800
amidst the flowers and small birds,

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,160
or perhaps in a good hotel.

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,900
when we feel the need to take a shower.

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,700
Oh, but a car rental,

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,920
It's going to cost you an arm and a leg.

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,800
You're not thinking about it.

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
Listen, I have an idea

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,780
I just bought a Méhari

24
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,060
A camel?

25
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,800
No, not a Méhari, a Méhari

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,020
A car will be perfect for the summer.

27
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,860
This is exactly what you need

28
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,080
I'll bring it tomorrow, you'll see.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,080
That's nice, but I don't know if we should

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,340
Yes, yes, you'll see, it's a fantastic little car

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,600
It fits everywhere

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,460
We'll have a blast!

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,080
Oh, so you'd be coming with us?

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Yes, of course.

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,860
A little later, Mireille calls Colette.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,640
Hello, Colette? Are you coming to Paris this afternoon?

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,300
I absolutely must see you. It's urgent.

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,540
Okay, at 4 o'clock, at Passion du Fruit.

39
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,000
It's Quai de la Tournelle.

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,420
Okay, I'll wait for you. I'm giving you a kiss. Bye.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,700
A little later, Colette and Mireille find themselves drawn together by their passion for fruit.

42
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,820
Good morning.

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,180
How are you ?

44
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,620
Okay. So, what's going on?

45
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,900
Well, there you have it. But first, tell me, do you have any firm plans for the summer?

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,800
No, not really.

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,600
That's amazing. So listen, I have something to propose to you.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,820
First, I have to tell you that if you can accept, you'll make me a huge fan.

49
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,500
Mireille then tells Colette the story of the broken white glass, of the lottery ticket,

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,000
the travel plan with Robert and Hubert's intrusion.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,940
You can imagine that I'm not dying to find myself alone between Hubert and my American.

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,120
If you could come with us, that would solve everything and we could really have some fun.

53
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,020
When would you leave? And for how long?

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,040
We would leave in about two weeks and come back, let's say, at the end of August.

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,860
Unless we have enough before then.

56
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,000
That could be fun.

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,240
Anyway, I have no desire to stay in Provins with my parents.

58
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,400
Listen, yes, in principle, I accept.

59
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,000
Fantastic, you saved my life.

60
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,780
And with four people, it will surely be more interesting.

61
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,580
The following Sunday, Mireille goes to see her children.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,560
It's a group of girls and boys that she looked after last summer.

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,840
as a counselor at a summer camp.

64
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:22,000
There was also Jean-Michel as an instructor, a very friendly young man, with leftist leanings, whom the children adored.

65
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,560
At the end of the summer, Mireille and Jean-Michel decided to stay in touch with the group and bring them together every Sunday morning.

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,160
It was to this weekly meeting that Mireille went today.

67
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,840
After the meeting...

68
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,680
I have to tell you, I don't think I'll be able to go to summer camp this summer.

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,340
I'm exhausted, I can't take it anymore.

70
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,380
I need to take a real vacation. You see, I'm changing my perspective a bit.

71
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,320
It's true you look tired, but do you take vitamins?

72
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,080
No, doctor.

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,360
I also need a change of scenery.

74
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,700
Actually, I wanted to tell you, I won't be able to come after next Sunday.

75
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,080
And Mireille tells Jean-Michel about her plans for the summer.

76
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,180
She doesn't mention the broken white glass, nor the lottery.

77
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,960
but she talks about the planned trip with Robert, Hubert's intrusion, and the call to Colette.

78
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,220
And then suddenly...

79
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm thinking about it, why don't you come with us?

80
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,780
That's what would take your mind off things.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,420
Seriously, are you kidding me?

82
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,780
Can you picture me, between that degenerate aristocrat and that American savage?

83
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,640
What would I be doing in that mess?

84
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,460
First of all, it's not a galley, it's a mehari.

85
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,100
And Hubert is not degenerate at all, I assure you.

86
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,020
And my American is anything but a savage.

87
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,760
He is a very educated, very cultured boy.

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,940
You'll be able to talk to him, you'll see.

89
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,540
This will be very interesting for both of them.

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,980
Come on, come with us.

91
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,580
With five of us, we'll have a blast.

92
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,220
And Mireille finally convinced Jean-Michel.

93
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,460
Now, they need to explain to Robert that they're going to leave as a group of five.

94
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,420
and to Hubert that there will be five people in his little Méhari.

95
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,060
Well, you know, our projects are taking shape.

96
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
In fact, everything is arranged.

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,060
I have a lot of good news.

98
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,460
First, Hubert, our priests, Sam and Harry.

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,900
That's nice.

100
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,040
But I don't know if we should...

101
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,600
Naturally, he will come with us.

102
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:18,880
Ah.

103
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,140
I also thought I should be wary of that camel.

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,980
No, seriously, I don't think it works very well with three people.

105
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,560
That's what I thought too.

106
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,480
So, I invited Colette to come and she accepted.

107
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,620
Damn. Will there be four of us?

108
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,000
No, you'll see, there won't be four of us, there will be five.

109
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,240
Because I also invited a wonderful, super nice guy.

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
His name is Jean-Michel.

111
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,260
I'm sure you'll like it.

112
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,840
He's a very interesting guy.

113
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,360
He is a Trotskyist or a Guevarist or something like that.

114
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,140
With Hubert being rather right-wing, sparks are going to fly.

115
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,800
This will be very interesting for you.

116
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,180
That, I have no doubt about.

117
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,100
But I would still have preferred solitude for two.

118
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:11,420
There you go, she's pretty, isn't she?

119
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,440
Mireille, Hubert and the Méhari.

120
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,500
This is the camel for long summer hikes.

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,220
Simple, durable, versatile.

122
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,100
Do you want to try it?

123
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,220
So I spoke to Robert, it's settled, he agrees

124
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,700
But we thought that it might not work very well with three people

125
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,660
As well as I asked Colette to accompany us

126
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,060
And she was kind enough to accept

127
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,620
But the Méhari isn't expandable.

128
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,580
With four of us, we'll be packed in like sardines.

129
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,420
Malon, Hubert, I know you

130
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,560
Despite your innocent, childlike demeanor

131
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,740
I wouldn't be surprised if you were upset about being squeezed against Colette.

132
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,120
Tight as it is, my dear Mireille, I would have preferred it to be against you

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:11,080
Oh, and also, before I forget, I had my boyfriend yesterday.

134
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,080
You know, Jean-Michel, he seemed really depressed

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,580
It's good that I invited him to come too.

136
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,020
But that boy is a dangerous anarchist.

137
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,880
He's not an anarchist at all, he's a Marxist.

138
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,240
I thought it would balance out your outdated opinions.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,520
But where do you want to put all those people?

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
The Méhari doesn't have an upper deck, I'll have you know.

141
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,460
Okay, we might be a little cramped, but it doesn't matter.

142
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,620
The crazier you are, the more you laugh, as my Aunt Georgette says.

143
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,480
And she doesn't laugh much, poor thing.

144
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
Are you going to let me stay home?

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,280
Yes.

146
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,660
Hubert thinks that Mireille shouldn't leave alone with Robert.

147
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,280
But why not?

148
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,680
But after two days, you'll be bored to death.

149
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,960
I don't see why I would get bored with him.

150
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,300
It's the verb "s'ennuyer" (to be bored). Do you remember?

151
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,760
Jean-Pierre is bored. He looks bored.

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,740
I'm bored.

153
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,080
She's bored.

154
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm bored. There's nothing to do.

155
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,080
And he's bored there? No, he's having fun.

156
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,540
He's bored. But she's having fun.

157
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,480
Oh, because I'm having fun. I've never had so much fun.

158
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,160
They are having fun too.

159
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,460
Are they bored or are they having fun?

160
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,120
They are having fun.

161
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,760
Mireille won't be bored.

162
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,400
No, on the contrary, travelling with a stranger, showing them everything you love, must be exciting.

163
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,040
And how do you plan to travel around France?

164
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,720
The Hexagon is France.

165
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,780
Mireille and Robert are going to travel to France

166
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,540
They will travel across France

167
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:05,240
When you travel, you can spend the night in a hotel, in a tent, or even in the middle of a field, outdoors.

168
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:13,140
Here are fields, a field, a field, a field, a field

169
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,840
And they run across the field.

170
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,200
We will spend the nights in the open field, under a tree, surrounded by flowers and small birds.

171
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,340
Or perhaps in a nice hotel, when we feel the need to take a shower.

172
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:36,340
Look at Robert and Mireille there. They're hot, they're dirty, they feel the need to take a shower.

173
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,180
It's the verb "to feel".

174
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,920
Look at Mireille here, she's tired

175
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,480
She feels the need to rest

176
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,720
It's cold here, but she doesn't feel the cold.

177
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,480
But here, she feels the cold.

178
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,440
To leave, Robert and Mireille are going to rent a car.

179
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,380
But Hubert doesn't think it's a good idea.

180
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,420
Because it's going to cost them an arm and a leg.

181
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,380
But renting a car is going to cost you an arm and a leg.

182
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,240
It's going to cost a lot, a horribly lot.

183
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,900
The eyes of the head.

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,400
An Alpine Renault, you think that's expensive?

185
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,260
Probably very expensive.

186
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
It costs an arm and a leg.

187
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,940
Hubert has a better idea.

188
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,020
Listen, I have an idea.

189
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,680
An idea, remember?

190
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,700
I have an idea.

191
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,940
Let's play portrait.

192
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,740
Yes, that's an idea.

193
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,340
Is this a good idea?

194
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,220
Yes, it's funny the ideas we have when we're little.

195
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,020
Newton had an idea.

196
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,180
I, too, had some rather bizarre ideas.

197
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,880
What are you reading?

198
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,440
Lacan.

199
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,380
What an idea!

200
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,920
Hubert has just bought an old Méhari.

201
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,700
A méharie is a type of camel.

202
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,520
A Méhari is a small car.

203
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,860
You'll see, it's a great little car.

204
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,080
It fits everywhere.

205
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,340
Here's a small car that can go anywhere.

206
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,940
The camel is a frugal animal.

207
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,380
He doesn't drink much. He can travel dozens of kilometers without drinking.

208
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:21,080
The poet Guillaume Apollinaire said, the camel travels without drinking, I drink without traveling.

209
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,100
The camel is sober. Apollinaire was less sober.

210
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,060
The Méhari is economical. It doesn't consume much petrol. The Renault 5 is also economical.

211
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:45,000
Mireille meets Colette at La Passion du Fruit, a fruit juice bar on the quays.

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,920
Ask Colette what she plans to do this summer, and if you have any farm projects.

213
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,460
For this summer, firm projects are definitive, things that cannot be changed; an apple is firm, but

214
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,600
But that is less firm, it can change shape, we can change it, modify it.

215
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:14,280
Mireille tells the story of the lottery ticket, the travel plan with Robert, and Hubert's intrusion.

216
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,260
Hubert is an intruder, nobody invited him.

217
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
Jean-Pierre is also an intruder.

218
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,700
Mireille suggests that Colette come along because she doesn't want to be alone between Hubert and Robert.

219
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,720
You can imagine I'm not exactly dying to be left alone between Hubert and my American boyfriend.

220
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,620
If Colette agrees, it will help Mireille.

221
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,100
Mireille likes it when people do her favors.

222
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,020
Can you give me that sheet of paper?

223
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,740
Marie-Laure is doing him a favor

224
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,200
Can you lend me 50 francs?

225
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,020
Will you give them back to me?

226
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,560
Of course I'll give them back to you.

227
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,540
When she lends him money, she is doing him a favor.

228
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,140
They intend to leave in about two weeks.

229
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,120
One week, eight days. About eight days.

230
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,960
Two weeks, fifteen days. About fifteen days.

231
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,660
We would leave in about two weeks.

232
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,380
And we would come back, let's say, at the end of August.

233
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,780
Or before, if we've had enough.

234
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,680
They've had enough.

235
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,700
He's had enough too.

236
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,160
That could be fun. Anyway, I have no desire to stay in Provins with my parents.

237
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,020
Listen to the conversation between Mireille and Colette, then you will take on the role of Colette.

238
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,220
If you could come with us, that would solve everything and we could really have some fun.

239
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,100
And when would you leave? And for how long?

240
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,980
We would leave in about two weeks and come back, let's say, at the end of August, unless we have had enough before then.

241
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,080
That could be fun.

242
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,680
Listen, yes, in principle I accept you now, you are Colette, if you

243
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,320
If you could come with us, everything would be sorted out and we could really have fun.

244
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:06,080
When would you leave and for how long?

245
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:15,220
How long would it be for, when would you be leaving, and what would it be for?

246
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,740
How long would we be leaving in about two weeks and returning at the end of the year?

247
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,640
August or before if we have enough it could be fun listen yes in

248
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:35,980
In principle, I accept, it could be fun. Listen, yes, in principle, I accept.

249
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:47,740
That could be fun, listen, yes, in principle I agree. Mireille is happy that Collette

250
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:55,960
Accept, that's wonderful, you're saving my life, you're saving my life, she's exaggerating, him, yes, he's saving her

251
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:13,360
They saved his life, yes you saved our nephew, fasten your seatbelts!

252
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,760
can save your life the following Sunday Mireille goes to see her children they are

253
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,220
Children who were at a summer camp last summer.

254
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,660
Mireille was a counselor at this summer camp.

255
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,580
She was taking care of her children.

256
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,740
There was also an instructor, a very friendly instructor, Jean-Michel.

257
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,140
Jean-Michel and Mireille continue to take care of his children.

258
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,620
They bring them together every Sunday.

259
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,360
They are having a meeting.

260
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,820
This is a workers' meeting.

261
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,260
The workers gather to discuss.

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,080
I didn't want us to meet, it's not my business, it's yours.

263
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,260
Did you perhaps think we were going to do the work for you?

264
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,940
Is that why you held the meeting?

265
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,420
I'm very glad that we're all together.

266
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
Jean-Michel is very tired.

267
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,860
He can't take it anymore.

268
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,020
He's exhausted.

269
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm exhausted, I can't take it anymore.

270
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,160
Phew! I can't take it anymore.

271
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,260
I'm exhausted.

272
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
She's exhausted.

273
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
She can't take it anymore.

274
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
He can't take it anymore. He's exhausted.

275
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,700
Ah, I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.

276
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,760
Jean-Michel needs a change of scenery. I need to take a real vacation. You see, I'm changing my perspective a bit.

277
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,500
Mireille also needs a change of scenery. I also need a change of scenery.

278
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
It's stifling in here.

279
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,260
I need a change of scenery.

280
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,140
It feels good to get a change of scenery.

281
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,440
Marie-Laure is going to change her clothes.

282
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,960
I want to wear my pink dress. May I?

283
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,260
Okay, if you're up for it.

284
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,920
Now she's going to change her t-shirt.

285
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,000
Go on, go change your t-shirt.

286
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,880
And she changed her dress.

287
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,320
People like change.

288
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,540
Have you changed your anger water?

289
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:26,900
Yeah.

290
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Don't you want to change the record?

291
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,720
Why don't you like this one?

292
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,600
And he, he changes gears.

293
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,100
Jean-Michel needs a change of scenery

294
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,740
because he is depressed, tired.

295
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,120
He looked really depressed.

296
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,800
She is depressed.

297
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,020
Autumn and winter are depressing.

298
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,440
Montreal, early November.

299
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,200
It's raining, it's snowing, it's cold.

300
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,720
He looked really depressed.

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,520
He's really depressed.

302
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,960
Phew! I don't understand this problem at all.

303
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,260
It's really tough.

304
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,300
It's good ?

305
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,680
Yeah, it's really great.

306
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:27,500
She's really good, listen, we have a really important appointment, but it's not sad, it's

307
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,780
It's really great when you get divorced because you have two houses and two Christmas anniversaries.

308
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:38,140
Going on vacation is really great when you're getting divorced. Mireille suggests to Jean-Michel that he come with them.

309
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,580
But now that I think about it, why don't you come with us? That'll take our minds off things.

310
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Are you kidding me?

311
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,460
Jean-Michel isn't very polite. He means, "Are you making fun of me?"

312
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,700
Can you see me, between that degenerate, savage American aristocrat?

313
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,540
What would I be doing in that mess?

314
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:03,320
A galley is a boat where you have to row hard. Nobody wants to go on a galley.

315
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,560
Mireille defends Robert.

316
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,680
He is a very educated, very cultured boy.

317
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:21,460
He is very cultured. Heidegger, Freud, Lévi-Strauss, Picasso, Lacan, Leeming, Sartre, Mishima.

318
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:31,780
Sylvestre, you are a very intelligent man. You are not very cultured, but you are very intelligent, I'm sure.

319
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,580
Mireille finally convinces Jean-Michel. She convinces him.

320
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,140
One.

321
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,320
Non.

322
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,300
Yes, it does.

323
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,040
Non.

324
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,740
Come on, let's go.

325
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,600
Good.

326
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,620
Ah.

327
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,000
Now, Mireille explains the situation to Robert.

328
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,780
Well, you know, our projects are taking shape.

329
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,120
That's still vague, but it's taking shape.

330
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,740
It's taking shape.

331
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,900
The glass is taking shape.

332
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,220
The car is taking shape.

333
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,980
First, Hubert lends us his Méhari.

334
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,020
Ah.

335
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,120
And naturally, he will come with us.

336
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,840
I thought to myself that I should be wary of that camel.

337
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,160
Did you understand? Robert is making a pun.

338
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,020
Camel, camel.

339
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,320
Camel, camel.

340
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,620
He was wary of Hubert's camel, that old camel.

341
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,000
Ah, he's got a sharp mind, that boy.

342
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Robert is not happy

343
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,840
Damn, there will be four of us.

344
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,000
But Mireille reassures him

345
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
This will be very interesting.

346
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,400
Especially because Jean-Michel is a bit of a leftist

347
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,860
Is he a Trotskyist or a Guevarist? I'm not entirely sure.

348
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,540
And Hubert is rather right-wing

349
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,180
Then sparks will fly.

350
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,140
Sparks

351
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,780
There are sparks!

352
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,380
Sparks

353
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,820
"This will be very interesting for you."

354
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,340
"I have no doubt about that."

355
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,880
"Oh, I don't doubt it, I'm sure of it."

356
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,320
"But I would still have preferred solitude with someone else."

357
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,340
"Ah, the solitude of being alone together."

358
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,660
Hubert is not happy either.

359
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,540
Five people is too many.

360
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,380
"Hey, but the Méhari isn't expandable."

361
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,380
This table is extendable, but the mehari is not extendable.

362
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,460
The Méhari doesn't have an upper deck, I'll have you know.

363
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,980
There are buses that have an upper deck.

364
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,000
But the Méhari doesn't have an upper deck, I'll have you know.

365
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,280
It's a quarter past one, I'll have you know.

366
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,000
The Méhari is not expandable.

367
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,960
With four of us, we'll be packed in like sardines.

368
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,940
Malon, Hubert, I know you, despite your innocent, boyish ways.

369
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,120
I wouldn't be surprised if you were upset about being squeezed against Colette.

370
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,220
Hubert has the air of an altar boy.

371
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,980
He looks innocent, prudish, like an altar boy

372
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,300
Here is a choirboy

373
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,080
A child at heart

374
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,880
But he wouldn't mind being pressed up against Colette

375
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,280
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell? Are you angry?

376
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,300
Yes, I'm angry.

377
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,200
Mireille went to the cinema and she didn't want to take me.

378
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,660
He's angry too.

379
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,720
Hey, cut off my body!

380
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,940
Mom !

381
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,180
Shut up and go to sleep. I'm very angry.

382
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,940
But can't you be careful, can you, you dirty little girl?

383
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,880
She is angry.

384
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,600
But he's not angry.

385
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,720
Okay, we might be a little cramped, but it doesn't matter.

386
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,600
The crazier you are, the more you laugh, as my Aunt Georgette says.

387
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,680
She, who never laughs, by the way.

388
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,380
We'll have a blast.

389
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,580
In five days, we'll have a blast.

390
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,820
They're having a blast.

391
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,720
They're having a blast.

392
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,180
But they're completely crazy, those women.

393
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,920
Now, let's see what you know.

394
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,760
Listen, watch, think, and speak.

395
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,220
Look at these people.

396
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,760
Are they bored to death or are they having a blast?

397
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,180
They're having a blast.

398
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,560
Yes, they're having a blast.

399
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,860
What is it? A galley or a camel?

400
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,100
A camel car.

401
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,280
A camel car.

402
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,280
An Alpine, do you think it's cheap or does it cost an arm and a leg?

403
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,080
It costs an arm and a leg.

404
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,840
Yes, it costs an arm and a leg.

405
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,280
What is Marie-Laure doing here?

406
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,980
She changes her t-shirt

407
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,300
She changes her t-shirt, very good

408
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:14,100
Where is he spending the night here, in a nice hotel or in the middle of a field?

409
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,920
In the middle of the field

410
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,040
Very good. In the middle of a field.

411
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,020
What is it? A field or a holiday camp?

412
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,160
A summer camp.

413
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,180
A summer camp.

414
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Look at your classmate. Does he look fit or does he look exhausted?

415
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,560
He looks exhausted.

416
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,220
Yes, I can't take it anymore.

417
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,820
He looks exhausted.

418
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,340
And Jean-Michel, does he look happy or depressed?

419
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,440
Depressed.

420
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,700
Depressed.

421
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:57,780
What's wrong, Mr. Guignol? Are you feeling unwell? You look depressed.

422
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,980
I'm tired. I'm exhausted. I can't take it anymore. I've had enough.

423
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,600
I'm bored. I'm bored to death.

424
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,020
My friend Robert and I are going to do the Tour de France by car.

425
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,460
Come with us, Mr. Guignol.

426
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Will that take your mind off things?

427
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,840
What would I be doing on the roads with two crazy young people?

428
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,880
No, I'm going to take a short nap.

429
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,140
But Mr. Guignol, come on! We'll have a blast!

430
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,700
Come on, join us! The more the merrier!

431
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,140
Yeah, I prefer to sleep! Have a good trip, come on, have a good trip!
