00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,380
and get involved.

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,740
Very soon, you will see what happens

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,200
and you will be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,120
Uncle Guillaume encourages Mireille

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,780
to spend their lottery money on memorable food.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,240
But Mireille prefers Robert's plan

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,400
to travel around France.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,880
Robert continues to have misunderstandings

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,760
with the employees, this time on clothing.

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,080
And he takes a disgusting taxi route.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,980
MFP subtitles.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,380
Listen, we need to celebrate this, right?

14
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,820
And Uncle Guillaume invites Mireille to have tea at the Grande Cascade.

15
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,480
Four hours, is that okay with you?

16
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,740
Yes.

17
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,300
Okay, then, perfect, shall I come and pick you up?

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,360
No, no, I'll manage.

19
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,220
Are you sure?

20
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, then, at four o'clock.

21
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,220
Okay, see you later. Goodbye.

22
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,980
At four o'clock, Mireille arrives at the Grande Cascade tea room.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,440
So, you won 40,000 francs?

24
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,160
What are you going to do with it?

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,020
I wonder about that.

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
Aunt Georgette would like me to give her money for her dog cemetery.

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,720
That's definitely her.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,580
She's the spitting image of Georgette, that's true.

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,760
There are millions of children dying of hunger all over the world.

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,420
And all he cares about is ensuring a decent burial for deceased dogs.

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,560
What an old camel, that Georgette.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,480
Oh, you're not being nice, uncle.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,740
Aunt Paulette has another idea.

34
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,880
Yes ?

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,100
She says I should buy her old car.

36
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,980
Whoa there, watch out.

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,180
It's a very beautiful car, but it hasn't been driven since the exodus of 1940.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,740
And as for a car, I can always lend you one.

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
You don't need to buy a car.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,020
That includes insurance, gas, and repairs.

41
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,620
You'd be better off using your old uncle's.

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,760
Philippe advises me to buy shares on the stock exchange.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
Ouch, watch out.

44
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,980
Ah yes, the stock market is falling right now.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,500
It might not be a good investment.

46
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,680
Personally, I'd advise you to have a few good feasts.

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,840
with friends.

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,520
You could try all the restaurants

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
three stars in Paris.

50
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,920
You should keep the menus; they'll give you memories.

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,840
for your old age.

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,360
The good memories are still

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,060
the safest bet.

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,000
You know very well that I have to be careful

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,660
to my liver.

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,240
Another one of your mother's inventions.

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,000
Your liver isn't any worse than the 55 million

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,600
other French people.

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,860
You'll just have to do a treatment

60
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,400
other bichis.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,600
You know very well that since Pétain,

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,320
Dad doesn't want to hear about Vichy at home anymore.

63
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,920
You still have Vittel, Evian, Badoit, Vals and Volvic left.

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,200
No, anyway, I have to say that the idea of ​​spending

65
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,100
three or four hundred francs for a meal,

66
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,880
I find it almost immoral.

67
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,960
No, you know, I think I'll take a trip to France instead.

68
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
with my American boyfriend.

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,480
You know, Robert, besides, the money is partly his.

70
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
He was the one who paid for the ticket.

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,560
Robert, in the men's clothing department.

72
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,780
We'll take care of you.

73
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,820
Non.

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
I would like a jacket.

75
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,140
Or a sports jacket, perhaps.

76
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,540
Something I could wear in the city.

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,940
And also for camping.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Do you have a particular color in mind?

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,820
No, not really.

80
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,460
I don't really care.

81
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,580
French blue, perhaps.

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,680
And above all, something that isn't too messy.

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,280
What size are you?

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,260
Honestly, I don't know.

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Let me see, if you please, I'll take your chest measurement.

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
THANKS.

87
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
124.

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Here, this one should suit you.

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
That's your size.

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
It's not really dark blue.

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
This is the only one we have in your size.

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,020
We're out of blue. This one is yellow and white.

93
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,580
That's what I thought, yes.

94
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,160
Here, give it a try.

95
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,080
It fits you like a glove. It's exactly what you need.

96
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,400
I still don't like the color. Well, with this, I won't go unnoticed.

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,880
You'll be able to see me from afar.

98
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,420
If I get lost, I'll be easily found.

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,780
I would also like a pair of trousers.

100
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,540
You need to do 88 as detailed.

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,620
Oh no, 83.

102
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,900
Here.

103
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,420
These are very nice corduroy trousers.

104
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,800
The color would go very well with your jacket.

105
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,640
Non.

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,480
Here, this is an article made of polyester.

107
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,220
It's a very beautiful fabric.

108
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,440
It holds the crease very well.

109
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,480
It is...

110
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,540
It's both, how should I put it...

111
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,680
How should I put it...

112
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,240
Well, I would simply say...

113
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,140
Sporty and dressy.

114
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,140
Do you want to try it?

115
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,420
No, no, it's time to go, I'll take it.

116
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,460
You don't need a shirt?

117
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,380
It's very good for the trip.

118
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,280
It washes very easily and dries in a few minutes.

119
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,500
No, thank you.

120
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,400
Underwear?

121
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,140
I don't have any underwear.

122
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,720
Underwear, then?

123
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,140
I don't have any more underwear either.

124
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,380
So, what are you wearing?

125
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,640
You're not wearing anything underneath?

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,400
Yes, I do wear those kinds of little things...

127
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,660
Yes, that's what I was saying, briefs.

128
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,760
But I think briefs are for ladies.

129
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,440
Oh yes, we also have some for the ladies. But they're with lace. It's more feminine.

130
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,700
Uh, no thanks. With or without lace, I have everything I need.

131
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,980
As he left the store, Robert spotted a taxi that seemed to be waiting. He got in and gave the address of the Latin home.

132
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,920
The taxi starts immediately and speeds through Parisian traffic with alarming speed and clumsiness.

133
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,920
It advances in fits and starts.

134
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,900
It is a succession of short accelerations and longer accelerations.

135
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,960
Intrigued and vaguely worried, Robert seeks the cause of this phenomenon.

136
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,620
He notices that it is indeed the driver's foot that is causing irregular jerking to the accelerator.

137
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,820
This foot is wearing a black shoe, over which appears a red sock.

138
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:23,060
On closer inspection, Robert realizes that it is actually the end of a pair of long red wool underpants.

139
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:37,540
Intrigued and worried, Robert is even more so when he sees in the rearview mirror that the driver blinks one eye then the other in perfect synchronization with the acceleration.

140
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,100
Suddenly, Robert realizes that they are passing by the Saint-Lazare train station.

141
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:49,540
"But where are you going? I told you Rue du Somme-Rare, it's the opposite direction."

142
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,100
The driver does not respond, but gives a tremendous burst of acceleration.

143
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,800
Robert, being a cautious young man, takes advantage of the interval between two accelerations to jump out of the moving taxi.

144
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,440
And this one drives off, flashing its turn signals in Morse code.

145
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:37,420
Subtitling by Radio-Canada

146
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:46,540
birthday. Here, we're celebrating Marie-Laure's birthday. Here, we're celebrating July 14th. It's

147
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:54,480
The national holiday in France. Here, we're celebrating the arrival of a new director. Here, we're celebrating

148
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:07,920
Christmas. Here too, we celebrate Christmas. And here, we celebrate the New Year, the New Year.

149
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,560
New Year's Day. And look at them, they won the lottery, so they're going to celebrate.

150
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:27,480
Listen to the conversation between Mireille and Uncle Guillaume, then you will play the role of

151
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,520
Uncle Guillaume, I just won forty thousand francs in the national lottery, no joke.

152
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:40,020
But that's fantastic! And there you go, rich! Listen, we have to celebrate this! Now it's your turn, you are...

153
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,920
Uncle Guillaume, I just won forty thousand francs in the lottery.

154
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,060
national seems, but that's fantastic and

155
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,780
Well, listen, we need to celebrate, it seems, but it's fantastic!

156
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,880
Well, listen up, we need to celebrate!

157
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:14,440
Uncle Guillaume invited Mireille for tea.

158
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,600
They too are having tea.

159
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,980
It looks delicious.

160
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,420
It's a little bit of a mix of Earl Grey and Darjeeling.

161
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,640
Uncle Guillaume invited Mireille to a very chic place.

162
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,820
A restaurant and tea room in the Bois de Boulogne, near the Longchamp racecourse.

163
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,440
Uncle Guillaume asks Mireille what she's going to do with the money she earned

164
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,240
What are you going to do with it?

165
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,100
Well, I wonder.

166
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,760
Aunt Georgette would like me to give her money for her dog cemetery

167
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,360
Uncle Guillaume makes fun of Aunt Georgette

168
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,720
Ah, that's her, she's the spitting image of Georgette.

169
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,240
Ah, that's definitely her, she's the spitting image of Georgette!

170
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,380
That's her to a T, it looks just like her.

171
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,720
Look at that, it's Aunt Georgette

172
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,400
And does this look like him?

173
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,060
Yes, that's her exactly.

174
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,900
Look how much Cécile resembles Mireille in this photo.

175
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,680
That's Mireille to a T.

176
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,060
Spitting through, from the verb to spit

177
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,640
Do you remember? A window spewing flames

178
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,880
And here's someone breathing fire

179
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,460
But in the subway, it is forbidden to spit, even fire.

180
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,440
Uncle Guillaume makes fun of Aunt Georgette

181
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,720
Because she runs a dog cemetery

182
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,020
All he cares about is ensuring a decent burial for the deceased dog

183
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,440
A burial site, a grave.

184
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,980
In a cemetery, there are graves.

185
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,220
This is Chopin's tomb, his burial place at Père Lachaise.

186
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,580
Aunt Georgette is in charge of providing decent burials.

187
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,900
to the deceased dogs, to the pooches.

188
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,640
Here's a little dog.

189
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,960
Aunt Georgette has a dog.

190
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,320
And Marie-Laure has a tutu, because she does dance.

191
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,860
A dog, a tutu.

192
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,820
Uncle Guillaume is not at all nice to his sister.

193
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,360
He calls her an old camel.

194
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,560
What an old camel, Tête Georgette!

195
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,960
Help me! Figure it out yourself!

196
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,440
Old camel!

197
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,920
Here's a camel.

198
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,680
What an old camel, Tête Georgette!

199
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,660
Aunt Paulette would like Mireille to buy her car.

200
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,640
But Uncle Guillaume disagrees.

201
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,640
He advises Mireille not to buy it.

202
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,720
Be careful.

203
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,640
Whoa there, watch out.

204
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,720
Be careful. Pay attention.

205
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,680
Jean-Claude, be careful.

206
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,640
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's suspicious.

207
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,140
Can you lend me 50 francs?

208
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,120
Will you give them back to me?

209
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
Of course I'll give them back to you.

210
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,180
When ?

211
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,960
Tomorrow morning.

212
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,900
On ?

213
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,340
She's cautious, that little girl. She's wary.

214
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,900
She's right. You always have to be wary.

215
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,600
You never know what might happen.

216
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Look at him, he wasn't suspicious, and this is what happened to him.

217
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
One must always be wary.

218
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,020
Look at him, he's running calmly, he's not suspicious, and BANG!

219
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,020
There's a string.

220
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,020
Be careful, little Anne.

221
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
One must always be wary.

222
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
You shouldn't accept anything from a stranger.

223
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
That's a suspicious father.

224
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
What is that croissant?

225
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,020
Did your mother give you the money?

226
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,020
No, it was Mr. Alain who took it.

227
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,020
I already told you not to accept anything from a man you don't know, right?

228
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
So who lives here?

229
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,020
He is suspicious.

230
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,020
It's best if I leave.

231
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:47,020
Mireille should be wary because Aunt Paulette's car is a very beautiful car, but it is old.

232
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,020
And it hasn't been driven since the exodus of 1940.

233
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,500
In 1940, the Germans invaded France

234
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,720
and the population took to the roads to flee the Germans.

235
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,040
Mireille doesn't need to buy Aunt Paulette's old car.

236
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,340
You don't need to buy a car.

237
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,080
She can still use Uncle Guillaume's car.

238
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,200
You'd be better off using your old uncle's.

239
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,200
That's Uncle Guillaume's car.

240
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,380
Mireille uses Uncle Guillaume's car.

241
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,040
That's a pen.

242
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,300
She uses a pen to write.

243
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,300
That's a wrench.

244
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,780
Marie-Laure uses an adjustable wrench

245
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,640
That's a corkscrew.

246
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,720
Mr. Courtois uses a corkscrew

247
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,420
He uses a shovel to collect the dead leaves.

248
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,500
That's a hammer.

249
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,960
They use a hammer

250
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,640
He uses a hammer

251
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:55,860
And he uses an iron bar to open the door; Mireille's cousin advises him

252
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:03,840
to buy shares on the stock exchange, one buys and sells securities, shares of

253
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,320
Different companies, but Uncle Guillaume doesn't agree. Watch out, the stock market is falling.

254
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:19,880
It goes up, it goes down. The temperature rises, the temperature falls.

255
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,320
If stock market values ​​fall, it's not a good investment.

256
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,260
But if they go up, it's a good investment.

257
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:36,820
In general, real estate, land, houses, apartments, and construction are a good investment.

258
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:44,360
Uncle Guillaume advises Mireille to have some good feasts with friends

259
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,080
I would advise you to have some good meals with friends instead.

260
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,060
A feast, now that's a feast, a feast, a good meal with friends

261
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:02,260
Uncle Guillaume advises Mireille to go and enjoy some good meals in three-star restaurants

262
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,080
In the Michelin Guide, very good restaurants have one star.

263
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,240
The very, very good restaurants have two stars.

264
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,520
And exceptional restaurants have three stars.

265
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,720
One star

266
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,880
The Place de l'Étoile in Paris is shaped like a star.

267
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,940
You could try all the three-star restaurants in Paris.

268
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,280
You would keep the menus; they would give you memories for your old age.

269
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,240
Mireille is worried about her liver

270
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,480
But you know I have to take care of my liver.

271
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,840
Feasting is not good for the liver

272
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,360
The liver.

273
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,280
Many French people have liver problems because of goletons.

274
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,540
Prometheus, on the other hand, had liver problems because of the eagle.

275
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,020
If you have liver pain, you should drink mineral water such as Vichy water.

276
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,900
Then all you have to do is a Vichy water cure.

277
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,120
Unfortunately, Mr. Bello doesn't want to hear anything about Vichy.

278
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,780
He doesn't want to hear about it. He hates it.

279
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,380
"You know very well that ever since Pétain, Dad doesn't want to hear about Vichy at home anymore."

280
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,780
Not because of the water, but because of Marshal Pétain.

281
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,980
Because during the German occupation, Pétain had established his government in Vichy.

282
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,640
And Mr. Belleau was against Pétain and collaboration with the Germans.

283
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,880
Fortunately, there is plenty of mineral water in France.

284
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,940
"Well, you still have Vittel, Evian, Badoit, Vals and Volvic."

285
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,000
In any case, Mireille doesn't want to spend her money on food.

286
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,540
No, you know, I think I'm going to take a trip to France with my American boyfriend instead.

287
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,180
And you, what would you do if you had won the lottery?

288
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,580
A very beautiful trip.

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,720
I too would love to visit America.

290
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,280
Me too.

291
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,980
I think I would buy a lot of books.

292
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,520
Robert, meanwhile, is trying to buy a jacket to go and explore France.

293
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Do you have a particular color in mind?

294
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,200
No, not really.

295
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,820
I don't really care.

296
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,460
He doesn't care, it doesn't matter.

297
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,400
Which one do you want?

298
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,460
Oh, I don't care.

299
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,080
Okay, so I'll take the cream puff.

300
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,220
Oh, that's just the one I wanted.

301
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,620
You need to know, do you care or not?

302
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,820
I don't mind. I prefer cream puffs.

303
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,180
Non.

304
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,640
You should have told me if you didn't care.

305
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,340
I don't mind, so I'll have the chocolate éclair.

306
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,560
Is that okay with you?

307
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,200
He doesn't mind, but he doesn't want something that's too messy.

308
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,140
Not white, for example.

309
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,060
Because white gets dirty easily.

310
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,760
It gets dirty easily.

311
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,280
White gets dirty easily.

312
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,800
Oyster farming is a dirty job.

313
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,880
It's the halls.

314
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,260
Replacing roof tiles is also a dirty job.

315
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,800
You shouldn't be afraid of getting tired or getting dirty.

316
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,000
The children get dirty.

317
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,980
Dark blue doesn't show dirt too much.

318
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,240
But light blue gets dirty easily.

319
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,640
Robert wants dark blue, but he doesn't know his size.

320
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,780
Excuse me, I'm going to take your chest measurement.

321
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,600
Listen to the conversation between the salesman and Robert.

322
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,720
Next, you will play the role of Robert.

323
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,180
Are we taking care of you?

324
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,600
No, I would like a jacket.

325
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,320
Do you have a particular color in mind?

326
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,980
I don't care.

327
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,220
Something that isn't too messy.

328
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,920
Now it's your turn, you are Robert.

329
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,120
Are we taking care of you?

330
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:45,520
No, I'd like a jacket. No, I'd like a jacket. No, I'd like a...

331
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
jacket, you're set on a particular color

332
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,080
I don't mind if it's not too messy.

333
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,580
something that isn't too messy

334
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,360
I don't care

335
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,600
something that isn't too messy

336
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,940
Robert tries on a jacket

337
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,740
He puts it on to try it out.

338
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,100
Colette tries on a Mireille sweater

339
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,620
And he's trying on a t-shirt

340
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,680
and this lady is trying on a jacket

341
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,460
in a fitting room

342
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,940
but it doesn't suit her

343
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,960
she is too small

344
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,260
The dress fits very well here.

345
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,780
Turn around.

346
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,080
Very nice.

347
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, does that look good on you?

348
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,480
Oh no, it's a change for you, but it suits you very well.

349
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,300
This little black skirt suits me well.

350
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,220
But Mireille's sweater looks very good on Colette.

351
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,320
It fits him like a glove.

352
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,800
Oh, it fits you like a glove.

353
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Like a glove.

354
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,040
It's exactly your size.

355
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,040
According to the seller, the jacket fits Robert like a glove.

356
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,940
"It fits you like a glove."

357
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,700
But Robert doesn't like the color.

358
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:12,820
"I still don't like the color. But with this, I won't go unnoticed. I'll be visible from afar. If I get lost, I'll be easily found."

359
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,540
Then Robert looks at the trousers.

360
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:30,020
"Here, have you got a very nice pair of corduroy trousers. Here, have you got an item made of polyester."

361
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:40,680
Loom, fabric. A fabric merchant, fabrics, fabrics. There are fabrics of

362
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:49,560
Cotton, silk fabrics, wool fabrics, there you go, wool, the wool of buttons. The

363
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:56,320
Sweaters are made of wool, but it's not fabric, it's knit. Polyester, dacron, nylon,

364
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,420
It's convenient because it dries quickly.

365
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,240
Here's a shirt drying.

366
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,600
Laundry drying.

367
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,040
A hair dryer.

368
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,500
Sec.

369
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,160
A cake, a dry cake.

370
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,600
A tree, a dry tree.

371
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,080
A humid climate, a dry climate.

372
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,640
Then the salesman offers Robert some underwear.

373
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,100
Underwear?

374
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,920
Robert doesn't understand because he thinks in English.

375
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,220
In English, briefs are for ladies.

376
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,600
Me, but I don't wear underwear.

377
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,920
So, what are you wearing?

378
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,960
You're not wearing anything underneath?

379
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,900
He doesn't want any underwear.

380
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,560
He doesn't want any underwear either.

381
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,400
So, he leaves.

382
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,180
And since he's rich, he takes a taxi.

383
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,660
The driver of this taxi is strange.

384
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,520
He drives very fast and very clumsily.

385
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,220
He is clumsy.

386
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,340
Jean-Claude is on the right. Oh, there, he's clumsy.

387
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,880
Skill, clumsiness. He's a bit clumsy.

388
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,400
She's clumsy. She's clumsy too.

389
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,620
The taxi moves forward in erratic leaps. They too are making erratic leaps.

390
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:25,820
Robert sees in the rearview mirror that the driver blinks his eyes

391
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:34,040
A rearview mirror, a rearview mirror, a rearview mirror, a rearview mirror

392
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,820
Okay, enough about rearview mirrors.

393
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,160
Are you out of your mind?

394
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,680
Robert took a taxi from La Samaritaine.

395
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,980
He wants to go to his hotel on Somrar Street

396
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,400
And suddenly, he realizes they are at the Saint-Lazare train station, here

397
00:24:48,400 --> 00:25:03,880
It's the opposite. So Robert jumps out while it's moving. He wants to get in while it's moving. And the taxi drives off, flashing its turn signals like Morse code.

398
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:10,580
Here, the plane is getting closer, and there, it's moving away.

399
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,420
Now listen, watch, think, and speak.

400
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,660
Are they having tea or a feast?

401
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,580
They are having tea.

402
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,880
Is it a puppy or a tutu?

403
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,620
A little dog.

404
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,620
And this?

405
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,540
A tutu.

406
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,600
Is that a camel or a dog?

407
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,300
A camel.

408
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,800
A camel, very good.

409
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,460
Does Jean-Claude trust him or is he suspicious?

410
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,720
He is suspicious.

411
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,160
Is the stock market falling or rising?

412
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,920
It's decreasing.

413
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,800
Is that wool or cotton?

414
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,860
Wool.

415
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,720
wool

416
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,440
If you're at La Samaritaine, is the Saint-Lazare train station on the same side as the Latin Quarter, or is it on the opposite side?

417
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
It's the opposite, it's the opposite.

418
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,600
If you are French and you eat too much and drink too much wine, or do you have pain

419
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
In the liver

420
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,980
Oh dear, you're not well, Mr. Guignol, you're drinking too much! You need to take a Vichy water cure, Mr. Guignol!

421
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,400
Hey, I don't really like that.

422
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,700
Well then, a meat water cure, Mr. Guignol.

423
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,560
I don't like it much either.

424
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,060
But then, Mr. Guignol, there's badoit.

425
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,960
I don't like mineral water.

426
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,940
I prefer Beaujolais.
