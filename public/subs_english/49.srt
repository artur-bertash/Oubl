3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,980
The small square behind the Saint-Germain church.

4
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,960
Greetings to the aristocrat!

5
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,700
Hello Crapule, how are you?

6
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,320
Are we the first?

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,000
Ah, ah, well here comes the Merloque rolling in, it's mechanical.

8
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,240
And Colette.

9
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,720
Good morning.

10
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,000
Good morning.

11
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,160
How are you ?

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,560
Okay, Colette.

13
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,980
Mireille isn't with you?

14
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,800
You know very well that she was taking her exam.

15
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,880
Oh!

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,600
There it is!

17
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,660
So, how are you? Did it go well?

18
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,240
It's over, we're not talking about it anymore.

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,320
Let's talk about something else, if you don't mind.

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,500
Travel, for example.

21
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,540
For me, what I like best about traveling is the preparation.

22
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,460
Make plans.

23
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:55,780
Yes.

24
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,960
In my opinion, we need to get organized.

25
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,060
Let's get settled.

26
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,320
We can't just leave like that, randomly.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,360
You need to have a... a central theme, a common thread.

28
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,160
It could be... castles.

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,420
Or Romanesque churches.

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,880
I have a better idea.

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,560
I propose a cultural and educational tour of France.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,840
For example, a systematic study of cured meats and cheeses from France.

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,220
France is trying 300 cheeses.

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,740
Ah, what richness, what variety.

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:40,520
We could start with Normandy as planned, with Camembert and Pont l'Évêque for cheeses, rillettes from Le Mans and andouille de Vire for charcuterie.

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,920
Andouille de Vire? Oh no, how awful! How vulgar, it's made with pig tripe.

37
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,760
So what? Tripe is delicious. Camp-style tripe.

38
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,980
Oh well, that's not good.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,680
Oh, stop it, you're bothering us with your food. That's all you ever think about. There's more to life than that.

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,580
First of all, Normandy is too rich, too fatty, too much cream, too much butter.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,780
It's a country steeped in materialism.

42
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,620
Grasse.

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,020
Tell me about Brittany instead.

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,800
This is a country with a soul.

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,620
It's austere, mystical.

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,760
All these Breton calvaries sculpted in granite, Saint-Hégonèque, Guimillot, Plougastel.

47
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,680
And the Breton pardons with all those women in headdresses following the procession.

48
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,320
Oh yes.

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,640
Yes, Brittany is interesting.

50
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,180
There are crepes.

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,760
Cancale oysters, lobster à l'armoricaine.

52
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,680
American style.

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,500
In the Armorican style.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,580
It's an old Breton recipe, obviously.

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,600
No, not at all.

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,040
Where did you get that from?

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,140
You've fallen on your head.

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,420
It's lobster à l'américaine.

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,360
In Brittany, everyone knows that.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,140
Anyway, it's very good.

61
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,520
We could organize our trip around regional specialties.

62
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,980
Toulouse cassoulet, Alsatian sauerkraut,

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,000
Savoyard fondue, Aix calissons.

64
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,380
Yes, my dear Colette.

65
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,440
It is true that cooking, confectionery, pastry

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,040
are among the highest expressions of French culture.

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,140
But that's not all.

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,520
There are also Limoges porcelains,

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,720
Valoris pottery, Aubusson tapestries.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,380
The lace of Le Puy, the Basque linen.

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Oh, you two are bothering me with your crafts.

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
The best that the Basque Country has to offer,

73
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
It's Basque pelota and chicken.

74
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,500
Chicken, for chicken, I prefer Mireille's chicken.

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,700
Oh, you're annoying me with your low-class gallantries.

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,920
Pelota, Basque chicken and Maillol ham.

77
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,020
Well, my name is Guillaume, and he's a real gourmet, and he claims that the mountain ham you find in Auvergne is better.

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,480
What's interesting about Auvergne is the water.

79
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,600
Ham waters?

80
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Ah, that's good.

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,420
Thermal waters. Vichy, La Bourboule, Mont d'Or.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,020
Thermal waters and volcanoes.

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,700
Very little. Everything is dying out, these volcanoes.

84
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,680
And for a long time.

85
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,440
But thankfully. What would we do with erupting volcanoes in our sweet France?

86
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,060
France is the land of reason, a civilized country.

87
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,700
The fury of nature, cataclysms, that's not our style.

88
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,380
We prefer the calm of a palm tree swaying on the sea.

89
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,140
A palm tree? France may well be paradise on earth.

90
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,960
But I doubt you have many palm trees in France.

91
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,860
This? There are palm trees on the French Riviera, like in Africa or Florida?

92
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,660
There's everything in France, my dear.

93
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,680
No kidding.

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,000
You have... sequoias, for example.

95
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,040
Redwood trees? No, of course not, they're too big.

96
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,520
I just told you that France is the land of reason and moderation.

97
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,640
There are no sequoias, but in all the public gardens,

98
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,040
There are cedars from Lebanon, brought back by Jussieu in his hat.

99
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,200
There are also sequoia trees.

100
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,920
Not as big as those in California, but they exist.

101
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,940
And then we have magnificent fir forests in the Vosges and the Alps.

102
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,640
As in Canada or Norway.

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,980
Large pine forests in the Landes region.

104
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,100
For resin and paper.

105
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,940
And even cork oaks, like in Portugal.

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,080
To make corks.

107
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,720
Wine corks are very important.

108
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,360
There's everything. Absolutely everything.

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,980
Wheat, like in Ukraine or Kansas.

110
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:24,480
Corn, like in Hungary or Iowa. Rice, like in China or Cambodia.

111
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,160
Rice? I laugh at rice. You must be joking? I doubt you have much rice in

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,540
France. Yes, indeed! For once, I must admit that Hubert is right. We produce

113
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,780
There's a lot of rice in the south of France, in the Camargue. Have you heard of the Camargue?

114
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,820
That's great! You'll have to go, I'm sure you'll like it.

115
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,800
There are wild horses, wild bulls, and cowboys.

116
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,660
Like in Texas.

117
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,820
Only in the Camargue are they called guardians.

118
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,580
But it's the same thing. There are even pink flamingos.

119
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,580
Just like in Egypt.

120
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,020
And sugarcane. Do you have that in France?

121
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,220
Of course we have them in Martinique.

122
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,440
Okay, let's say you have sugar.

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,840
But do you have any coffee?

124
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,460
Coffee with milk in bed, every morning, with croissants.

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,380
Obviously, the coffee comes from Brazil, Colombia or Ivory Coast.

126
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,940
And do you have any olive trees?

127
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,760
But yes, of course we have some in the south, thankfully.

128
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,020
What would we use to make olive oil, yoli, or mayonnaise?

129
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,440
I don't really like olive oil, it has too strong a taste.

130
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,640
At my house, we cook everything with butter.

131
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,640
At home, we cook everything with oil.

132
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,580
In my family, who are from the southwest, we cook with fat.

133
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,320
Ah, hey, that reminds me of a version I did in fifth grade.

134
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,540
It was by César, if I'm not mistaken.

135
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,340
Galia, Omnia, Devisas and Partestres, which I had translated.

136
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,000
France is divided into three parts.

137
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,940
Butter-producing France in the north, oil-producing France in the south,

138
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,620
and France from Greece in the center and southwest.

139
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,300
Well, you must not have been very good at Latin translation.

140
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,660
Ah yes, when Caesar said that Gaul was divided into three parts,

141
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,440
It has nothing to do with fat.

142
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,180
Really ?

143
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,480
Actually, I'll tell you.

144
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,180
The truth is that the wine-growing region of France is located in the South.

145
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,420
Beer in France, in the East and the North,

146
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,640
and cider-making in the West, in Brittany and Normandy.

147
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,740
Ah, cider, how I love it.

148
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,200
I could really go for a bottle of that, actually.

149
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,200
So be it.

150
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,320
Let's go get a pot of loot.

151
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,380
Oh, good idea.

152
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
So, shall we go?

153
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,240
Here we go.

154
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,900
Mireille and Robert have a meeting with Hubert, Colette and Jean-Michel

155
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,340
in the small garden opposite the two macaques.

156
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,660
Hubert and Jean-Michel arrive before the others.

157
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,840
Are we the first?

158
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,200
Here, Marie-Laure is the first to arrive.

159
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,700
I was the first one to arrive.

160
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,220
Hubert and Jean-Michel arrive first at the meeting point.

161
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,880
Greetings to the aristocrat.

162
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,660
The aristocrat, the aristocrat.

163
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,040
You remember that Hubert de Pinochambrun is an aristocrat.

164
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,460
Jean-Michel is more familiar.

165
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,380
He calls him the aristocrat.

166
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,380
Hubert responds in the same tone.

167
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,220
Hello, you scoundrel, how are you?

168
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,440
Scoundrel, gangster, bandit.

169
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,340
Look at me closely, you.

170
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,280
You don't look very well.

171
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,880
Me?

172
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,400
There they are.

173
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,900
I knew you had stolen them from me.

174
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,300
you little scoundrel.

175
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,760
Look at that guy.

176
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,480
He doesn't look right.

177
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,740
He looks like a real scoundrel.

178
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,540
Thugs who kidnap a young woman.

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,360
It's me, but what about you...

180
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,940
Thugs who attacked an old lady.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,760
So, they came back together.

182
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,260
They were wearing masks.

183
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,720
They hit me

184
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,820
to make me tell where my savings were.

185
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,280
And here come the scoundrels.

186
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,440
who have just robbed a bank.

187
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,440
They too are scoundrels, but rather likeable ones.

188
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,640
Greetings, the aristocrat!

189
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
Hello, you scoundrel, how are you?

190
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,120
Are we the first?

191
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,840
Ah! Ah!

192
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,800
Look, here comes the Merloque rolling in, it's a machine.

193
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,560
The aristocrat, scoundrel, that's a familiar term.

194
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
Merloque is also a familiar term.

195
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,200
Americans.

196
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,060
Americans.

197
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,400
The merloque, obviously, is Robert.

198
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,440
who arrives swaggering around.

199
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,520
by rolling his shoulders to give himself a more advantageous look,

200
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,460
to look sporty and muscular.

201
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,680
They're showing off.

202
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,900
Then Colette arrives and finally Mireille.

203
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,560
You remember that Mireille had an exam this afternoon.

204
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,680
Look, Mireille and Véronique have taken an exam.

205
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,640
Véronique succeeded, but Mireille is stuck.

206
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,140
Oh, I got it. I passed.

207
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,920
Formidable.

208
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,700
Oh, darn, I'm stuck.

209
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,940
Today, Mireille just took an exam.

210
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,580
He is asked if the exam went well.

211
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,800
Did it go well?

212
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
Look, things are going to go badly here.

213
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
You see, it went badly.

214
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,440
My God, Julien, what's going on?

215
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,440
What is it, Julien, what is it?

216
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,340
What happened?

217
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,240
It looks like things went wrong.

218
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,220
But here, things are going well.

219
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,240
Things are going badly here.

220
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,620
Mireille doesn't know if her exam went well or badly.

221
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,060
But it's over and she doesn't want to talk about it anymore.

222
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,740
It's over, we're not talking about it anymore.

223
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,900
Let's not talk about it anymore.

224
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,420
Come on, come on, it's over. Let's not talk about it anymore.

225
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,060
Let's talk about something else if you don't mind.

226
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,960
If it doesn't bother you, if it doesn't affect you.

227
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,560
"Hey, if it doesn't bother you, get out of here!"

228
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,920
"But that means a lot to me!"

229
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,760
Mireille no longer wants to talk about her exam.

230
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,420
She prefers to talk about the trip, preparing for it, organizing it, making plans.

231
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,960
These are gangsters making plans.

232
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,080
They are going to rob a bank.

233
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,660
These are engineers making plans.

234
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,720
Jean-Michel also wants to make plans.

235
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,100
He doesn't want to leave without a plan.

236
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,240
We can't just leave like that, randomly.

237
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,140
Here is a young woman who sets off at random

238
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,940
But Jean-Michel doesn't want to leave haphazardly.

239
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,200
He wants to get organized, to have a plan

240
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,120
You need to have a common thread, a theme

241
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,460
The conductor wires are very useful.

242
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,900
Ask Theseus, then.

243
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,200
You know, Theseus who entered the labyrinth to kill the Minotaur

244
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,800
He was very glad that Ariane gave him a guiding thread.

245
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:24,780
Mireille suggests Romanesque churches as a theme.

246
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:41,180
Romand, Gothic. Romand, Romand, Gothic. Romand, Romand, Romand, Gothic. Romand, Romand, Romand, Gothic.

247
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,140
Romanesque churches are all very well, but Colette has another idea.

248
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,260
I have a better idea. A systematic study of French cheeses and cured meats.

249
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,940
France is trying 300 cheeses. Ah, what a wealth, what a variety! We could start with Normandy, as planned.

250
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:10,900
In Normandy, there are many cows. So, obviously, there is a lot of milk, cream, cheese, Camembert, Pont-l'Évêque.

251
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,060
We also make a lot of charcuterie. In Vire, for example, we make andouille. Here's some andouille.

252
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,700
This is endouille from Vire, in Normandy.

253
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,460
And in Le Mans, there's the car race, of course.

254
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,580
But most importantly, this is where we make rillettes.

255
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,620
Pork rillettes.

256
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,520
And in Caen, there is a specialty of tripe.

257
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,280
Tripe à la mode de Caen.

258
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,900
Mireille protests.

259
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Oh, stop it, you're bothering us with your food.

260
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,840
That's all you think about.

261
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,300
Colette thinks of nothing but food.

262
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,780
All she thinks about is eating, about having food.

263
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,560
They too are interested in food; the French are always interested in...

264
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,460
Food from all countries, Australian food, you know the

265
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,700
Food is very important, of course, but there's more to it than that.

266
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,020
There's more to life than that.

267
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,040
You did your homework, homework, homework, school isn't just that in

268
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,780
Life goes on, right?

269
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,060
Oh! Mireille didn't

270
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,020
I want to go to Normandy

271
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,920
because she thinks it's a country

272
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,220
embedded in the material.

273
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,440
A country that is too rich

274
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,160
too greasy.

275
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,060
Here's some meat

276
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,960
lean and there's some meat

277
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,100
fat. There are a lot of

278
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,500
Fat. Butter, cream,

279
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,920
The deli meats, all that,

280
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,280
It's fatty. Look at this cheese.

281
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,140
is. 45%

282
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,620
of fat. Butter, grease, oil,

283
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,240
These are fats.

284
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,940
It's a country steeped in materialism.

285
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,840
Grasse.

286
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,960
Normandy is a land steeped in matter.

287
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,740
Sunk in. Do you remember?

288
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,180
The triumphal arch that is sinking.

289
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,000
And here, the sword is stuck in the ground.

290
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,000
What else is sinking?

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,800
The nails.

292
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,760
You'll see. I'll show you how to hammer in a nail.

293
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,520
There, it's in.

294
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,040
What is it?

295
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,860
The cork has sunk in.

296
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,560
You can't take it out anymore?

297
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,580
But you can see, it's sunk in.

298
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,660
Damn cork.

299
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,200
Marie-Laure is sunk deep into the sofa.

300
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,440
And Normandy is a country steeped in fat.

301
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,740
A rich, fat, materialistic country.

302
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,740
Mireille prefers Brittany because it is more austere.

303
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,620
Austere. Brittany is a religious, mystical country, a country with a soul.

304
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,480
You know, the body, the flesh, the bones, that's the matter, and the soul, that's the spiritual.

305
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,580
In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the body dies, but the soul does not die.

306
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,540
Here, a mass is said for the soul of the deceased.

307
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,520
Brittany is a country with a soul.

308
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,660
All these Breton calvaries sculpted in granite.

309
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:18,100
In Brittany, older women often wear traditional headdresses, especially to attend pardons (religious festivals).

310
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,360
Colette is more interested in gastronomy.

311
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,920
The pancakes.

312
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,140
But the crepes, then, as much as you want.

313
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,840
In fact, when I was little, we used to spend our holidays in Brittany.

314
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,780
So, a little sugar, with eggs, ham, salad, mushrooms, anchovies, cheese, etc.

315
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,400
As long as you wanted.

316
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,760
But that's not a crepe anymore, that's a pizza.

317
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,560
In Brittany, there are crepes, oysters and lobster.

318
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,880
On this point, the French disagree.

319
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,060
Some people are talking about lobster à l'armoricaine

320
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,820
and who say it's a typically Breton specialty

321
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,820
and others who say no, no, no, no, not at all,

322
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,360
It's lobster à l'américaine and it has nothing to do with Brittany.

323
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,800
À l'armoricaine, it's an old Breton recipe, obviously.

324
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,260
No, not at all. Where did you get that from?

325
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,620
You've lost your mind. It's lobster à l'américaine.

326
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,700
You fell on your head. He fell on his head.

327
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,600
You've fallen on your head.

328
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,900
Whether it's Breton-style or American-style, even cookbooks disagree.

329
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,920
Anyway, it's very good.

330
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,300
We could organize our trip around regional specialties.

331
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:40,680
Toulouse cassoulet, Alsatian sauerkraut, Savoyard fondue, Aix calissons.

332
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:51,340
Hubert agrees. French culture is expressed in confectionery and pastry making.

333
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,220
But that's not all.

334
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,060
But that's not all. There's also Limoges porcelain.

335
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:07,740
porcelain, Valoris pottery, Aubusson tapestries, lace from

336
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,280
well, the Basque canvas. The best thing about the Basque Country is pelota and the

337
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:18,440
Basque-style chicken. Chicken, for chicken, I prefer Mireille's chicken. Oh, you're telling us...

338
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,240
Don't bother with your low-class gallantries. Hubert is taking advantage of the fact that we're talking about chicken.

339
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,440
to slip in a gallant gesture to Mireille.

340
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,200
He's gallant. Gallant. Do you remember?

341
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,980
Here is an affectionate dog and a gallant gentleman.

342
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,000
Now that's a gentleman.

343
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,500
This one too is gallant.

344
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,620
But this gentleman is not gallant.

345
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,500
Hubert, on the other hand, is a gallant young man.

346
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,680
He is always paying compliments and showing gallantry to Mireille.

347
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,980
You are as fresh as a rose.

348
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,400
If it's going to be a close call, my dear Mireille, I'd prefer it to be against you.

349
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
Colette continues with her idea

350
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,500
Pelota, Basque chicken and Bayonne ham

351
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,760
Well, my uncle Guillaume, who's a real gourmet, claims that the mountain ham you find in Auvergne is better.

352
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,340
Hubert, for his part, finds that what's interesting about Auvergne is the water

353
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,140
Not water, no, water, mineral water, thermal water

354
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,260
The French have great faith in the virtues of thermal waters.

355
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,780
In Auvergne, there are many thermal spas.

356
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,960
Vichy, La Bourboule, Mont d'Or

357
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,920
Thermal waters and volcanoes

358
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,560
Everything is dying out, these volcanoes

359
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
And for a long time

360
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,120
But thankfully, what would we do with erupting volcanoes in our sweet France?

361
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,200
In Auvergne, there are volcanoes, but they are extinct.

362
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,980
Nature in France is calm, gentle

363
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,940
In France, we love softness, soft skin

364
00:20:52,940 --> 00:21:00,960
Soft linens, mild climates, mild temperatures

365
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,720
In France, we don't like the fury of nature, the cataclysms

366
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,200
Except in the theatre

367
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,640
We don't like the fury of nature.

368
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,700
That's not our style

369
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,940
Look at this lady, all these ordinary people, it's not her style

370
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:25,500
The fury of nature, cataclysms, that's not our thing

371
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,380
We prefer the calm of a palm tree swaying on the sea

372
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,660
A little girl swinging

373
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,400
A scale

374
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,280
A pendulum

375
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
A palm tree?

376
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,740
France may be paradise on earth

377
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,600
But I doubt you have many palm trees in France.

378
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,400
Yes, there are palm trees on the French Riviera.

379
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:53,940
Of course, there are palm trees on the French Riviera. It's paradise on earth. France is paradise.

380
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,100
There's everything in France, my dear.

381
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:04,340
No kidding. You have sequoia trees, for example?

382
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,440
Redwood trees? No, of course not, they're too big.

383
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,980
Are there sequoia trees in France?

384
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,600
No, it's too big. Maybe in the botanical garden.

385
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,780
What are sequoias like?

386
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,960
They are very, very large trees

387
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,500
There are no sequoias, but in all the public gardens there are cedars of Lebanon.

388
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,820
brought back by Jussieu in his hat

389
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:31,480
And then we have magnificent fir forests in the Vosges and the Alps

390
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,660
Large pine forests in the Landes region

391
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,800
In the Landes region, near the Atlantic coast, there are pine trees that produce resin.

392
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,580
and the wood used to make paper

393
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,040
And then there are also cork oaks.

394
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,260
To make corks.

395
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,900
Very important: wine stoppers.

396
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,120
And then there is wheat, corn, and rice.

397
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,840
Rice? I laugh at rice. You want to laugh?

398
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
But he's wrong. There are some. Don't laugh. It's serious.

399
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,900
A fair amount of rice is produced in the south of France, in the Camargue region.

400
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,380
Have you heard of the Camargue? It's amazing.

401
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,640
You'll have to go, I'm sure you'll like it.

402
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,640
There are wild horses, wild bulls, and cowboys.

403
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,460
Like in Texas.

404
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,720
Only in the Camargue are they called guardians.

405
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,860
But it's the same thing.

406
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,460
There are even pink flamingos.

407
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,040
And then, there is sugar cane in Martinique.

408
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,520
Do you have any coffee?

409
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,140
Coffee with milk in bed, every morning, with croissants.

410
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,120
And then, in the south, there are olive trees.

411
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,140
To make olive oil

412
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,800
To make mayonnaise

413
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,200
And the yoli

414
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,620
Listen to the exchange between Robert and Mireille

415
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,000
And then you will play the role of Mireille

416
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,360
Do you have any coffee?

417
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,060
Coffee with milk in bed

418
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,960
Every morning with croissants

419
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,600
Coffee with milk in bed

420
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,500
Every morning with croissants

421
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,480
Coffee with milk, in bed, every morning, with croissants.

422
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,880
And do you have any olive trees?

423
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,820
But yes, of course we have them, in the south, thankfully, what else would we use to make olive oil?

424
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,880
But yes, of course we have them, in the south, thankfully, what else would we use to make olive oil?

425
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,720
But yes, of course we have them, in the south, thankfully, what else would we use to make olive oil?

426
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,120
I don't really like olive oil.

427
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,120
It has too strong a taste.

428
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,320
At my house, we cook everything with butter.

429
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,140
At home, we cook everything with oil.

430
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,100
In my family, who are from the southwest, we cook with fat.

431
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,080
Hey, that reminds me of a version I did in fifth grade.

432
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,300
It was by César, if I'm not mistaken.

433
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,560
France, All,

434
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,100
Deoisa est en parte estresse, which I had translated.

435
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,760
France is divided into three parts.

436
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,080
The butter-growing region of France, in the north.

437
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,720
Oil in the South of France

438
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,400
And France from Greece in the Centre and the Southwest

439
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,180
In fact, I'm going to tell you

440
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,480
The truth is that there is a beer-producing France in the East and in the North.

441
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,740
Wine France in the South

442
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,880
And cider-producing France in the West, in Brittany and Normandy

443
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,180
Ah, cider, how I love it!

444
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,620
I could really go for a bottle of that, actually.

445
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,580
Never mind that

446
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,980
No problem, it's easy, no issue.

447
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,480
So kids, are we going to the countryside this weekend?

448
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,160
Oh yes! The car has broken down.

449
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,660
No problem, Guillaume will lend us one of his.

450
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,260
Never mind that, let's go drink a pot of magot.

451
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
Okay, let's see what you've learned.

452
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,480
Observe, reflect, and speak.

453
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,980
Are these Romanesque or Gothic churches?

454
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,200
Romanes.

455
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,980
Is this Roman or Gothic?

456
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:15,220
Gothic, what interests Colette, Monsieur Courtois and his people? Food, what is it?

457
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:24,620
Wheat, rice, or corn, corn, Colette bores you because she talks about it all the time.

458
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:30,780
She's exaggerating about food, so what are you saying? There's more to life than that. Okay, now

459
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,740
Now, look.

460
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,860
But I doubt you have many palm trees in France.

461
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,920
I doubt you have much rice in France.

462
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,780
What do you have?

463
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,780
Have you got it?

464
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,780
What is this ?

465
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,720
It's the subjunctive mood.

466
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,780
The subjunctive mood, the subjunctive mood.

467
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,540
There's more to life than that.

468
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:29,780
...

469
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:59,760
French subtitles?

470
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:29,760
Subtitles ST' 501

471
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:59,760
