00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and fly away.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And you will be able to say a few things

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In French, yourself.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The door of the door, once again.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Marie-Laure reports that there was a man dressed in black

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
who asked if she had a sister

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
who resembled an actress.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
She sent it, and Mireille is angry.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Perhaps that was his big chance.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
At the same time, Robert tries, in vain,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to arrange the workroom at Belle-Ôse.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,900
Thursday evening, we're still at the table at the Bélots' house.

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,160
In that respect, we can say that we worked on this street house.

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,820
Oh la la!

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,300
That's probably why I became so attached to it.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,080
The bell rings again. Everyone stops eating and talking.

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,360
Marie-Laure will open.

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,780
I wonder what it could be.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,760
So, what was it?

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,620
The brother of the nun from earlier.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,320
What is this all about?

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Yes, he had the same moustache as her.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,880
And what did he want?

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,400
He asked me if I had an older sister who looked like a movie actress.

28
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,700
And what did you say?

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,240
Well, that question. I said no, of course.

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,480
What nerve! It might have been the chance of a lifetime to make films.

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,020
Now, it's a failure.

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,560
Finally

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,140
That's really weird

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,780
It's true, I wanted to be an actress for a long time.

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,280
I dreamed of going to Hollywood

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,360
Playing the unknown woman on the Orient Express

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,380
Traveling, staying in luxury hotels

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,300
Now I don't know

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,540
It's crazy how attached I've become to our country house.

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,040
When I was little

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,340
I found this desire of many French people ridiculous.

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,600
To have a small house of their own

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,320
The kind of thing that's my dream, my rest

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,180
And now, as I get older

45
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,380
I'm starting to understand

46
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,400
Having your own little house

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,600
Even if it is very modest

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,020
I see

49
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,480
A cottage and a heart

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,620
Our house isn't really a cottage.

51
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,820
First, the roof is not thatched, but tiled

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,700
Oh, de la tuile ?

53
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,960
Wouldn't you prefer slate?

54
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,440
Personally, I find it so much more distinguished.

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,620
Ah, slate is very pretty, but it's more expensive.

56
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,220
And besides, it must be nice and heavy.

57
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,940
It's lighter than the tile

58
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,480
But obviously, that would be too heavy for your wooden houses

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,160
Why do you say our houses are made of wood?

60
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,300
You don't have a wooden house in France?

61
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,440
No, very few. A few chalets in the mountains.

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,000
But apart from that, we're building with solid materials.

63
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,360
Made of stone, bricks, or cement blocks.

64
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,980
In France, we like things that last.

65
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,740
Is your country house made of solid materials?

66
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,240
Of course, it's beautiful local stone.

67
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,540
And the walls are at least two or three hundred years old.

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,800
And I fully expect them to still be standing for my great-grandchildren.

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,940
You cannot have great-grandchildren.

70
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,360
And why is that?

71
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,580
You're too young, you're not even married.

72
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,400
I read in Le Monde that there are more than 300,000 students in Paris.

73
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,400
Where do they live?

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Well, it depends.

75
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,660
Those who are lucky enough to have their parents in Paris, like Mireille

76
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,540
They generally live in their own homes, of course.

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,340
And what about foreigners?

78
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,640
Some live in the university residence.

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,760
Most foreign countries have a house in the city.

80
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,660
Others stay in hotels or rent rooms from private individuals.

81
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,580
Some of them live with families.

82
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,800
They have their own room, a bathroom.

83
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
They eat their meal with the family.

84
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,960
A single meal or full board.

85
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,780
I thought French families were very closed off.

86
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,000
That's quite true in a way.

87
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,920
But there are people who take in foreign students.

88
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,000
Because they have an apartment that is too big for them,

89
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,520
that they need money, widowed ladies, pensioners.

90
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,880
There are also people who want to give their children foreign friends.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,800
The Belleau family would not, by chance, intend to receive strangers.

92
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,900
You know, we don't have a big apartment, we only have this one room.

93
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,580
Including the kitchen and bathroom.

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,660
I am neither a widow nor a retiree.

95
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,800
And Mireille doesn't need anyone to find her foreign friends.

96
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,200
She collects them.

97
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,700
In one year of university, she managed to meet a Canadian, a Chilean,

98
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,780
An Algerian woman, an Israeli man, a Syrian woman, a Tunisian man, an Egyptian man,

99
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,240
An Italian woman, a Japanese woman, a Danish woman.

100
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,220
Three English people, one German woman, two Americans and one Romanian man.

101
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,360
A Hungarian, a Turk, a Greek, a Spaniard, a Russian and a Swiss.

102
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,840
And you're forgetting a Swede.

103
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,440
Mireille talks about their country house.

104
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,340
She is very attached to it because she worked there a lot.

105
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,300
We can say that we worked on that street house.

106
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,980
Oh la la!

107
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,440
That's probably why I became so attached to it.

108
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,040
She has grown attached to this house. She loves it very much.

109
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,620
Attached has first and foremost a concrete meaning.

110
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,280
For example, the cowboy ties up his horse.

111
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,680
Whether in a plane or a car, you must fasten your seatbelt.

112
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,600
Please fasten your seatbelts.

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,720
In Greek mythology, Prometheus was chained to a rock.

114
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,180
They are tied up.

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,380
The goat is tied up too.

116
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,620
And then, there is a moral dimension.

117
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,320
Mireille is attached to her country house, not physically, but morally.

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,760
She loves him, she loves him very much.

119
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,020
She is very attached to her little sister, she loves her very much.

120
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,780
Marie-Laure is very attached to Uncle Guillaume, she likes him a lot.

121
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,760
It has to be said that he spoils her a lot.

122
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,420
She is very close to her uncle.

123
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,580
It has to be said that he spoils her a lot.

124
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,440
Aunt Georgette is very fond of Fido.

125
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,200
It's true, we do get attached to these little creatures.

126
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,160
Listen again to what Mireille says.

127
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,080
In that respect, we can say that we worked on this street house.

128
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,800
Oh la la!

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,220
That's probably why I became so attached to it.

130
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,080
That's why I became so attached to it.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,820
It really highlights the intensity.

132
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,200
Yes, you're right, people are so stupid.

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Yes, you're right, people are so stupid.

134
00:06:51,180 --> 00:07:04,300
"Why did you set fire to my cognac? It's so much nicer. Oh! It's so much nicer. Oh!"

135
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,000
"Oh, I would love to know the trick. Oh, I would love to know the trick."

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,100
You remember that in high school, there is a lot of material to study.

137
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,000
There is so much material that we don't have time to do art history.

138
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,380
"There are so many other subjects to study."

139
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,920
While Mireille is talking about her attachment to their country house, the doorbell rings.

140
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,240
Marie-Laure gets up and goes to see what it is.

141
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,820
I wonder what it could be.

142
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,300
Marie-Laure returns, very calm, and goes to sit down again.

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
So, what was it?

144
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,320
The brother of the nun from earlier.

145
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,380
What is this all about?

146
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,340
It's simple.

147
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,540
The doorbell rang a little while ago.

148
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:55,600
And Marie-Laure went to see, it was a nun, a funny nun actually, with a big black mustache.

149
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,140
A strange nun who was offering lottery tickets.

150
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,780
This time, it's not the sister, but someone who looks like her.

151
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,800
A man with a big black mustache, like the one our sister had earlier.

152
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,000
So, it must be his brother.

153
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,660
It must be the sister's brother.

154
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,060
That's clear, isn't it?

155
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,040
Okay, now listen carefully to the dialogue between Mrs. Belleau and Marie-Laure.

156
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,960
Next, you will try to explain things to Mrs. Belleau, who doesn't seem to understand very well.

157
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,100
So, what was it?

158
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,980
The brother of the nun from earlier.

159
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,800
What is this all about?

160
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,820
Yes, he had the same moustache as her.

161
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,940
Now, answer Mrs. Belleau as if you were Marie-Laure.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,640
So, what was it?

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,540
The brother of the nun from earlier.

164
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,780
The brother of the nun from earlier.

165
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,020
The brother of the nun from earlier.

166
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,660
The brother of the nun from earlier

167
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,500
What is this all about?

168
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,480
Yes, he had the same mustache as her.

169
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,820
Yes, he had the same mustache as her.

170
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,060
Yes, he had the same mustache as her.

171
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes, he had the same mustache as her.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,380
Yes, it's not bad.

173
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,260
But let's start again.

174
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,780
Pay close attention to the nun from earlier.

175
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,660
The brother of the nun from earlier

176
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,720
Let's go

177
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,440
So, what was it?

178
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,540
The brother of the nun from earlier

179
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,520
Top article

180
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,440
The brother of the nun from earlier

181
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,320
What is this all about?

182
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Yes, he had the same mustache as her.

183
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,760
Yes, he had the same mustache as her.

184
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,640
Yes, he had the same mustache as her.

185
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,100
Yes, he had the same mustache as her.

186
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,380
That ring of the doorbell, that was

187
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,660
the brother of the nun from earlier.

188
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,900
The nun from earlier.

189
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,460
Just now.

190
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,500
You remember that earlier

191
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,960
may have a past meaning.

192
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,360
Tout à l'heure means a short time ago.

193
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,180
That's recent history.

194
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,280
Here too.

195
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,040
Do you know the age of petrified water? Since when?

196
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,740
Since earlier.

197
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,360
And here too.

198
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,400
I called the courteous one earlier.

199
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,740
Or even here.

200
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,340
"Madam, it's the gentleman from earlier!"

201
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,380
Or even here.

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,680
"When I told her that Mom was looking for her earlier, it wasn't true. It was a joke."

203
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,740
But "tout à l'heure" can also mean "in a short time".

204
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,500
So it can indicate an immediate future, as in this example.

205
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,460
"Aren't you going to the museum?"

206
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,620
"Yes, if so, earlier."

207
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,460
"I'm leaving tomorrow. Well, in a little while. I'm leaving tomorrow. Well, in a little while."

208
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:47,680
The gentleman who just rang the bell asked Marie-Laure if she had a sister who looked like a movie actress.

209
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,980
He asked me if I had an older sister who looked like a movie actress.

210
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,280
Mireille was immediately interested.

211
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,600
And what did you say?

212
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,380
Well, I told him no, of course not, to that question.

213
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, that question! What a stupid question! The answer is obvious.

214
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,500
Well, I told him no, of course not, to that question.

215
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,840
What nerve! It might have been the chance of a lifetime to make films.

216
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,380
Now, it's a failure.

217
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,200
What nerve! Mireille is not happy.

218
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,520
She thinks Marie-Laure has a lot of nerve.

219
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,880
What nerve! What audacity!

220
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,740
Marie-Laure shouldn't have said that.

221
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,240
Look here.

222
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,020
It's Marie-Laure who thinks Mireille has some nerve.

223
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,440
because she took advantage of his absence to take his place.

224
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,400
Marie-Laure!

225
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,600
Yes !

226
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Mom is calling you.

227
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I know, I'm going.

228
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Well, well, you've got some nerve! What nerve?

229
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Come on, shoo, get out of here, this is my spot.

230
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Well, well, you've got some nerve! What nerve?

231
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,640
That's outrageous. Come on, get out of here. This is my spot.

232
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,560
It might have been the chance of a lifetime to make films.

233
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,100
Now, it's a failure.

234
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,960
The chance of a lifetime.

235
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,380
Mireille may have had a unique opportunity,

236
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,560
an opportunity to make films.

237
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,920
And now, it's a failure.

238
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,620
She lost that chance.

239
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,200
She missed the opportunity.

240
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,360
You can miss an opportunity, you can fail an exam.

241
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,620
Oh darn, I'm stuck.

242
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,820
You can mess up your life, you can also miss a train.

243
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,820
Mireille had long wanted to be an actress

244
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,960
Do you remember when she was little?

245
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,800
She wanted to be a nurse by day and an actress by night.

246
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,180
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was little?

247
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,060
I wanted to be a nurse and an actress

248
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,280
Nurse by day and actress by night

249
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,000
I dreamed of going to Hollywood

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,500
She dreamed, she imagined

251
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,540
She hoped to go to Hollywood

252
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,500
Playing the unknown woman on the Orient Express

253
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,620
A mysterious heroine on the Orient Express, the train that travels from Europe to the Orient.

254
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,060
A train full of mysteries and intrigue.

255
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,560
Watch this advertisement that plays on the myth of the Orient Express.

256
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,940
It was in January 1934, on the Orient Express, that I was going to meet the one I would never forget.

257
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:48,100
Of the woman I called the Oriental, all that would remain for me now would be an image and a scent.

258
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,840
L'Orientale, an unforgettable fragrance.

259
00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,400
When she was little, Mireille dreamed of travelling, of staying in luxury hotels.

260
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,120
But now she's aged.

261
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,080
And she becomes like all those French people who dream of having a little house of their own.

262
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,700
To own a house, even a very modest one, even a very small one.

263
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:23,660
These little houses that are called my dream, my goal, destiny, that's life, my rest, my work, murmurs the waves.

264
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,600
Minouche, Robert is making fun of her.

265
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,220
I see a cottage and a heart.

266
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:37,340
I see. Your dream is the banal cliché: a cottage and a heart.

267
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,640
A thatched cottage is a very modest little house with a thatched roof.

268
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,360
In the past, there were many thatched cottages in the countryside.

269
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,080
But today, it has become very rare.

270
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,080
And a heart is the seat of love and other feelings.

271
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,780
A cottage and a heart, that's a dream of happiness

272
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,100
in a small, very modest house,

273
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,880
Even if you're poor, with someone you love.

274
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Mireille protests.

275
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,880
Our house isn't really a cottage.

276
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,700
First, the roof is not thatched, but tiled.

277
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,340
There are essentially three types of roofs in France.

278
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,340
Thatched roofs, very rare today.

279
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
Next, the tiled roofs.

280
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,140
Tiled roofs are found mainly in the south of France.

281
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,080
That's a tiled roof.

282
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:37,440
And then there are the slates.

283
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,200
These are slate roofs.

284
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,880
Slate is lighter than tile, but it costs more.

285
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,680
It is considered more elegant than tile.

286
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,440
The roofs of castles are almost always made of slate.

287
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,840
The roofs of the houses are made of tiles or slate.

288
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,460
And the walls are solid.

289
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:07,820
That is to say, in stone, brick or cinder block, in cement block

290
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,840
Made of hard materials, like stone

291
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,620
Stone is hard

292
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,060
Many houses are made of stone

293
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:27,040
Castles and churches are also generally made of stone.

294
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,660
But we also build with bricks.

295
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,920
There are many brick houses.

296
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,220
And there are also old brick castles.

297
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,880
There are also some brick churches,

298
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,860
such as, for example, Albi Cathedral.

299
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,740
Many modern houses are also built out of cinder blocks and cement blocks.

300
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,300
But wood is not used much in construction, except for mountain chalets.

301
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,740
Generally, we build with permanent materials. That's the verb "to build".

302
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,220
Listen, let's see if you recognize the verb "to build".

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,700
My father was an architect and one day he built a villa by the sea for a famous surgeon.

304
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,700
My father was an architect and one day he built a villa by the sea for a famous surgeon.

305
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,220
We use wood for mountain chalets, but apart from that, we build with solid materials.

306
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,680
Apart from that, apart from the chalets, listen to Guylaine.

307
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,060
It's raining, I'm exhausted, but apart from that, it's fine.

308
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:41,340
In France, we build with durable materials because we like things that last, things that last a long time.

309
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,920
Stone is solid, it lasts a long time

310
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,900
Look at the Pont du Gard, it has lasted for almost 20 centuries, almost 2000 years.

311
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,400
The Carré house in Nîmes too

312
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,540
Stone lasts longer than wood

313
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,900
Roses are very pretty, but they don't last.

314
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,540
Chocolates don't last either.

315
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,500
Ebello's country house is solid, it's made of stone

316
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,720
And Mireille certainly hopes it will last a very long time.

317
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,160
Of course, it's beautiful local stone.

318
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
And the walls are at least two or three hundred years old.

319
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,460
And I hope they will still be standing for my great-grandchildren.

320
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,780
Stand up, remember?

321
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,240
Here, Mireille is standing

322
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,780
And here she is sitting

323
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,680
She is lying down here.

324
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,820
Standing

325
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,740
Sat

326
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:49,220
Lying down. Standing, sitting, standing, sitting, lying down. Standing, sitting.

327
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,680
So you work standing up then? Like me, you also work standing up.

328
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,680
Look at this wall, it's still standing. This piece of wall is still standing.

329
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:13,260
The Bélots' country house is very interesting, but Robert is more interested in housing for foreign students in Paris.

330
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,460
I read in Le Monde that there are over 300,000 students in Paris. Where do they live?

331
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,200
Well, it depends.

332
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,900
It depends. There are several cases, several possibilities.

333
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,820
First, there are the students whose parents live in Paris.

334
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,160
These people generally live with their parents.

335
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,160
It's simpler, it's more convenient, and above all, it's cheaper.

336
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,380
Mireille, for example, lives with her parents.

337
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,200
And then there are the international students.

338
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,200
That also depends.

339
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,220
There are foreign students who live in the university residence.

340
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,220
There are foreign students who live in the hotel.

341
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,460
They rent a room in a hotel, like Robert, for example.

342
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,560
And then there are also students who live with private individuals.

343
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:12,660
He rents a room from private individuals. A private individual could be Mr. Pellot or Aunt Georgette, for example, someone who is not a hotelier.

344
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:22,220
A hotelier rents rooms as a profession. A private individual can rent a room, but it is not their profession.

345
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,160
You can rent a room in a hotel or in a private house.

346
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,560
Similarly, there are taxis and there are private cars.

347
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,400
That's a taxi and that's a private car.

348
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,260
Let's see, let's ask this young girl if she is a student and where she lives.

349
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,540
Are you a student?

350
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,820
Yes, I'm at university.

351
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,260
Where do you live?

352
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,520
In the Parisian suburbs.

353
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,000
Where do you live?

354
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,880
The university campus?

355
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
Are you renting a room?

356
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,920
Or do you live with your parents?

357
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,080
No, I live with my parents

358
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,620
There are many foreign students

359
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,040
Who live in families

360
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,280
At private homes

361
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,000
They take up residence with a family

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,780
They have a room with a toilet.

363
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,440
A toilet is a small bathroom

364
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,720
But without a bathtub

365
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,060
There is essentially a sink

366
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,720
and they have one or all meals with the family.

367
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,360
Half board or full board.

368
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
I thought French families were very closed off.

369
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
That's quite true in a way.

370
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,900
In a sense, that's somewhat true, but it's not entirely true.

371
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,200
There are many families who receive strangers

372
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,380
because they think it's good for the children.

373
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,820
It's interesting for their children to meet foreigners.

374
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,540
Sometimes also because they are alone in a large apartment,

375
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,040
a widowed lady, for example, or a retiree,

376
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,960
a gentleman who no longer works, who is retired.

377
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,100
Sometimes because they need money.

378
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,040
They don't have enough money.

379
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,960
Look at this poor man, he needs money.

380
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,780
Hey buddy, you wouldn't happen to have five bucks so I can fill it up, would you?

381
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,540
Look at Mireille here, she needs a book.

382
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,780
Hey, can you pass me that book?

383
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,880
And then, she needs a sheet of paper.

384
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,500
Give me that sheet of paper, over there.

385
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,120
And then, she needs a pencil.

386
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,780
I need a pencil. Won't you get me one?

387
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,780
What else do you need? Do you need anything else?

388
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
You are an artist.

389
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,240
I forgot.

390
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,460
What do you have against artists? We need them.

391
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,800
What do you have against artists? We need them.

392
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,040
Tipou, you know I need you.

393
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,000
Tipou, you know I need you.

394
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,220
This conversation about foreign students staying with a family gives Robert some ideas.

395
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,320
The Bello family would not intend to receive strangers by chance.

396
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,920
But Ms. Bello disagrees.

397
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,200
First, their apartment isn't too big for them.

398
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,300
You know, we don't have a big apartment, we only have this one room.

399
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,980
Including the kitchen and bathroom.

400
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,660
And besides, Ms. Bello is not retired, since she still works at the Ministry of Health.

401
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,640
And she's not a widow either, since Mr. Bello is there.

402
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,940
He is not dead, he is still alive.

403
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,040
I am neither a widow nor a retiree.

404
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,180
And Mireille doesn't need anyone to find her foreign friends.

405
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,580
She collects them.

406
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,480
She has a lot of them.

407
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,360
She is very sociable.

408
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,160
She has many friends of all nationalities.

409
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,400
Oh well, never mind.

410
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,620
Robert will have to remain a Latin man.

411
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,900
Oh, that's a shame.

412
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,240
Now let's see what you have to say.

413
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,960
Look, listen, think, and speak.

414
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Does Mireille hate her sister or is she attached to her?

415
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,640
She is attached to her.

416
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,840
Now, Marie-Laure will tell you something strange.

417
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,920
What are you saying?

418
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,420
What is this all about?

419
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,940
What did you say?

420
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,400
What is this all about?

421
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,240
Your sister took your place while you were away.

422
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,940
You are outraged. What do you say?

423
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,120
Well, well, you've got some nerve! What nerve? Go on, get out!

424
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,300
Well, well, you've got some nerve! What nerve? Go on, get out!

425
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,800
Is this roof thatched or tiled?

426
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,520
Thatched.

427
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,480
Thatched, very nice. Is this roof slate or tile?

428
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,060
And tiles.

429
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:04,740
It's tiled, that's right. Is this roof thatched or slate?

430
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,740
Made of slate.

431
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,760
Slate roof. Are the walls here made of wood or stone?

432
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,780
Made of stone.

433
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,020
And here, are they made of wood or bricks?

434
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,860
Brick.

435
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,400
Made of brick, very good. And this chalet, is it made of wood or brick?

436
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:41,520
Made of wood, made of wood, is what Mireille is sitting, standing, or lying down, standing, standing?

437
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:53,700
Here, sitting, sitting, and here, lying down, lying down, and that's a taxi or a car.

438
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:01,980
A special car, a special car, in your opinion, that's...

439
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:10,080
a hotel or a private house a private house a private house

440
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:22,920
But what are you doing here, Mr. Guignol? I'm sleeping, Miss Mireille, but

441
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,260
No, Mr. Guignol, that's not right at all.

442
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,660
You can't sleep in my dining room.

443
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,060
You're dreaming.

444
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,660
Actually, Miss Mireille, I was dreaming.

445
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,940
I dreamt that I had a small, very modest house,

446
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,500
almost a cabbage patch, which was called my dream.

447
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,720
Yes, well, that's it.

448
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,720
Go sleep in the house of your dreams,

449
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,520
but not in my dining room.

450
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,140
Go away!

451
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,280
Oh no, we're not at home anymore.
