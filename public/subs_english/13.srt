00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You have to look and fly away.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you will be able to say a few words in French yourself.

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Robert and Mireille meet in the Sorbonne district.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They know each other.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When Mireille realizes she is late for an appointment,

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
She leaves,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
leaving Robert to contemplate the spring day

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and write a postcard to his mother.

Subtitling by Radio-Canada

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,380
Excuse me, miss, what's going on?

13
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,400
What is this about? What is he praying for? Why is he demonstrating?

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,840
I don't know, but they're probably right.

15
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,000
It's really beautiful, isn't it?

16
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,600
Yes, it's a beautiful morning.

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,260
Are you a student?

18
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,960
Yes, I study art history.

19
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,920
I come from the United States.

20
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,600
Ah, you're American.

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:00,860
Yes.

22
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,960
But you don't have an accent at all, for an American.

23
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,980
It's very kind of you to say that, but you know, I don't deserve any credit.

24
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,820
My mother is French.

25
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,540
Ah, your mother is French?

26
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:12,740
Yes.

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,920
When I was a child, I always spoke French with her.

28
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,820
How long have you been in France?

29
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,920
No, only since yesterday.

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,180
I just arrived.

31
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,200
And where do you live?

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
At the university residence?

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,740
The university campus?

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,900
The American house?

35
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,940
Oh no, I live in a small hotel in the neighborhood, the Home Latin.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,300
It's not luxurious, but it's clean and not very expensive.

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,880
And do you come to France often?

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,960
No, this is the first time.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,040
My mother is French, but my father didn't like France very much.

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,520
When I was little, we used to spend our holidays

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,840
in Bermuda or Latin America, where my father had interests.

42
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,520
Were you spending your holidays in South America?

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,520
But why do you say, my father didn't like it, had interests?

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,960
Is your father...

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,520
Oh no, no, no.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,100
My father is still alive.

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,200
He is even in excellent health.

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,300
But my parents are divorced and I no longer live with them.

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,980
My mother has remarried, this time to an Argentinian.

50
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,420
So Bermuda, family holidays, all that is in the past.

51
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,900
I understand.

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,160
And what did your father do when you were little?

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,300
He worked in a bank.

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,600
In fact, he has been working at the same bank for 25 years.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,940
Oh yes ?

56
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,600
And what kind of work does he do?

57
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,860
Is he a cashier, a night watchman?

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
He is the vice-president.

59
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,380
There's no such thing as a career leap, as my Aunt Georgette says.

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,940
Mireille remained silent for a few moments.

61
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,960
Excuse me, I have to go home.

62
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,080
Is it far from where you live?

63
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,800
Would you be willing to allow me to accompany you?

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,460
No, it's not far, it's very close to here.

65
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,800
And I'm happy to allow you to accompany me, as you say.

66
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,140
That's not what we say.

67
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,580
Yes, yes, but you look so ceremonious.

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,740
It's because I don't want to bother you.

69
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
You don't bore me at all.

70
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,980
Actually, to be honest, I think you're quite nice.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,360
Finally, I mean friendly.

72
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,820
Look, if you like, we can go sit for a few minutes in the Luxembourg Gardens.

73
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,220
It's very close to here and it's right next to my house.

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,800
And they go to the Luxembourg Gardens.

75
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:37,960
That's the Senate.

76
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,200
This is where the senators meet.

77
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,560
I live right across the street.

78
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:55,400
Hey, let's be here

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Oh dear, I forgot

80
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,120
I had to take my little sister to her dance class at 11:30.

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,560
What time is it? Noon? But what will Mom say? Excuse me, I'm off.

82
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,720
In the evening, on the corner of Place Saint-Michel, Robert is sitting on the terrace of a café.

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,520
He's going to write a postcard to his mom.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,840
My dear mother.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,740
What can I get you?

86
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,520
A coffee, please.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,700
An express? Very well.

88
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,740
I am sitting on the terrace of a café in Place Saint-Michel.

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
THANKS.

90
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,280
The sun is setting.

91
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,380
The sky is completely red behind the Louvre.

92
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,480
The weather is very mild.

93
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,660
It's a beautiful evening.

94
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,600
Parisian women wear white sweaters and red skirts.

95
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,080
They are very nice.

96
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,860
Goodbye, Robert.

97
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,600
Do you have any shades available, please?

98
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh no, you have to go to a post office or a tobacconist's shop.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,500
Oh really? How much is it?

100
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,240
4 francs 50.

101
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,700
Where is there a post office?

102
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,960
There's one over there, on the other side of the bridge, to the right.

103
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,820
Okay, thank you.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:44,740
Oh darn, it's closed.

105
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,100
It's May 29th.

106
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,320
It is 11 o'clock.

107
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,080
Observe.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:22,900
It's May 29th. It's 11 o'clock. It's June 10th. It's 9:10 am. It's summer. It's noon. It's morning. It's 7 o'clock. It's Monday. It's 8 o'clock. It's Tuesday. It's 9 o'clock.

109
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:40,720
Let's see if you can answer. What date is it? It's May 29th. And what date is this? It's May 28th. Careful. Now, what day is it? It's Wednesday.

110
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,280
And what day is it now?

111
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,700
It's Saturday

112
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,700
And what day is it now?

113
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,540
It's Thursday

114
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,580
Now, pay attention!

115
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,300
What season is it?

116
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,760
It's spring

117
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,240
And what season is it here?

118
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,160
It's winter

119
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
What time is it?

120
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,340
It is eleven o'clock

121
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,680
What time is it?

122
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,860
It is 2 o'clock.

123
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,720
Look at this young woman.

124
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,560
She's going to ask what time it is.

125
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
What time is it?

126
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,980
8:30.

127
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,240
We also say what time it is.

128
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,260
Look.

129
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,220
Oh, but what time is it?

130
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,300
12:10, miss.

131
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,120
So, what time is it?

132
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
Oh la la!

133
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Let's continue now.

134
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,100
What day is it?

135
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,660
It's May 29th.

136
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:56,740
What season is it? It's spring. What time is it? It's 10:50. Well, it's May 29th, it's 10:50, it's morning. It's a beautiful spring morning.

137
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,940
It's evening here.

138
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,180
It's a beautiful spring evening.

139
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,320
It's evening, it's a beautiful spring evening.

140
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,980
It's morning, it's a beautiful spring morning.

141
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,680
There are protesters.

142
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,340
Robert doesn't know what they're saying.

143
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,060
He doesn't know why they are protesting.

144
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,660
He doesn't know what's going on.

145
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,820
Excuse me, miss, what's going on?

146
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,000
Look at the little girl here.

147
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,420
That's not going well.

148
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,040
And his father doesn't know what's going on.

149
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,340
So, what's going on, my dear?

150
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,080
Robert doesn't know what it's about.

151
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
What's going on?

152
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,020
What is this about?

153
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,140
Mireille doesn't know what it's about either.

154
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,660
She doesn't know why he's protesting.

155
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,320
But she is sure they are right.

156
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,140
Why is he protesting?

157
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,540
I don't know, but they're probably right.

158
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,020
Okay, I'll stop.

159
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,060
You're right.

160
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,140
I think I'll take two or three

161
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,860
You're wrong, you're going to get sick

162
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,820
To be right, to be wrong

163
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,180
Do you want a candy?

164
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,680
No thanks

165
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,760
You're wrong, they're very good.

166
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,720
Are you a student?

167
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:09,920
Yes

168
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,400
What are you doing?

169
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,160
From the history of art

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,280
What are you saying?

171
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,680
I study art history

172
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,420
You are, you do, you say

173
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,380
I come from the United States

174
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,780
Robert comes from the United States

175
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:30,000
Now watch Mireille ask him if he comes to France often.

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,100
And do you come to France often?

177
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,140
I come from the United States

178
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,540
And do you come to France often?

179
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,220
Listen carefully, there are three different vowel sounds in this verb

180
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,500
I come, you come, they come

181
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,560
I come, you come, they come

182
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,360
I come from the United States

183
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,940
Oh, you're American?

184
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,180
Yes

185
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,300
But you don't have an accent at all for an American.

186
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,980
It's very kind of you to say that, but you know, I don't deserve any credit.

187
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,840
My mother is French.

188
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,760
Robert speaks French very well

189
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,800
He is American but he doesn't have an American accent when he speaks French.

190
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,980
That's normal because her mother is French.

191
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,320
He has no merit

192
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,720
And you? Is your mother French?

193
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,780
No, my mother is Spanish, so I have a slight Spanish accent.

194
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,240
Now, listen carefully to this dialogue. You are going to imitate Mireille.

195
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,980
I come from the United States.

196
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,320
Ah, you're American.

197
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,680
Now it's your turn. You are Mireille.

198
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,280
I come from the United States.

199
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,440
Ah, you're American? Ah, you're American?

200
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,560
Ah, you're American.

201
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,900
Yes.

202
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,740
Let's continue.

203
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,720
Listen to Mireille asking Robert where he lives.

204
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,760
And where do you live? At CITU?

205
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,500
Oh no, I live in a small hotel in the neighborhood.

206
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,080
Robert lives in a small hotel in the Latin Quarter.

207
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,840
Mireille lives in a house on rue de Vaugirard.

208
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,980
Robert's hotel is not a luxury hotel.

209
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,260
Now that, yes, that's a luxury hotel.

210
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,180
The Ritz in Paris is also a luxury hotel.

211
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,700
And this is a luxury apartment? Yes, it's a luxury apartment.

212
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,140
And this is a luxury apartment? No, this is not a luxury apartment.

213
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,000
It's not luxurious, but it's clean and not very expensive.

214
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,020
Robert's hotel is not luxurious, but it is clean.

215
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,940
Here's a clean room. Here's a less clean room.

216
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:53,600
Here is a gentleman who is clean, but here, he is not clean, he is dirty.

217
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,040
He is clean, but he is not clean, he is dirty.

218
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,380
Is this clean or is this dirty?

219
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,120
It's clean.

220
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,240
And is that clean?

221
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,540
No, it's dirty.

222
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
That's disgusting.

223
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,420
Robert's hotel isn't expensive, it's cheap.

224
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,880
120 francs isn't expensive, it's very cheap.

225
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,760
This is not a cheap hotel.

226
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,380
It's an expensive, luxurious, and expensive hotel.

227
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,060
Fruit is expensive here.

228
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,380
But here, fruit is cheap

229
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,340
Apricots for 4 francs, that's cheap

230
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,180
It's actually very cheap

231
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,800
Apricots at 5 francs are more expensive

232
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,340
But it's still a very good deal

233
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,880
This isn't a very expensive store.

234
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,560
It's a fairly cheap store

235
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,880
Yes, that's an expensive store.

236
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,760
That's not an expensive dress.

237
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,040
But that must be an expensive dress.

238
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,280
And this car?

239
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,880
Do you think it's an expensive car or a cheap car?

240
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,560
It's an expensive car.

241
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,940
And that's rather cheap.

242
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,000
And do you come to France often?

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,100
No, this is the first time.

244
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,220
Once, twice, three times.

245
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,980
Look there, I'm knocking once.

246
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,520
Now I knock twice.

247
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,000
And now, I'm going to strike three times.

248
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,760
And Robert, how many times has he been to France?

249
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,040
Four times? Three times? No

250
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,760
Twice? No

251
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,560
This is the first time

252
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,180
No, this is the first time

253
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,220
When I was little, we used to spend our holidays in Bermuda or Latin America

254
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:05,960
When he was little, Robert spent his holidays in Bermuda or South America

255
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:14,240
in Latin America, North America, Central America, South America, Latin America.

256
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,740
He always spent his holidays in Bermuda or South America.

257
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,500
It was a habit.

258
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,780
Mireille also has her habits.

259
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,660
For example, she usually sits on this bench.

260
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,180
Marie-Laure also has habits.

261
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,720
For example, she has the bad habit of picking her nose.

262
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,960
Robert and his parents used to spend their holidays in Latin America

263
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,120
because Robert's father had interests in Latin America.

264
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,680
He had businesses, financial interests.

265
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,260
Mireille wonders if Robert's father is dead.

266
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,960
No, no, no, he's not dead, he's still alive, he's alive

267
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,940
Oh no, no, no, my father is still alive, he's even in excellent health

268
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:17,160
Robert is alive too, Mireille too, she's alive, she lives, she's alive

269
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,420
Your teeth are also alive, if you brush them regularly

270
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,060
Your teeth are living things, remember to brush them

271
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:39,900
Uncle Guillaume is also alive. He's still alive. He's still alive. But Uncle Casimir is no longer alive. He's dead.

272
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:51,140
Sarah Bernhardt is dead too. Balzac is dead too. Edith Piaf is dead too. Chopin is dead too. They are no longer alive. They are dead.

273
00:17:51,140 --> 00:18:04,480
They are alive, they are dead. Mireille is alive. She lives. She lives with her parents. She lives in Paris, on rue de Vaugirard.

274
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:15,100
Question: Does Mireille live with Robert? No. She lives with her parents.

275
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:22,420
Robert's mother lives in Argentina because she remarried an Argentinian.

276
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:31,360
Robert's father lives in the United States. He is a banker. He works in a bank.

277
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,160
That's a bank, a French bank.

278
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,520
That's a French bank too. Crédit Agricole is also a French bank.

279
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:57,520
These are French banks. But Robert's father works at an American bank. He's a vice president. This gentleman also works at a bank. He's a teller. He's at the cash register.

280
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,480
This lady is also at the checkout.

281
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,100
She's a cashier, but in a cafe, not a bank.

282
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,320
This lady is also a cashier, but in a cinema.

283
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,520
And this gentleman is a night watchman.

284
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,140
Being a cashier is a job.

285
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,840
It's a useful, honorable profession.

286
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,640
Being a night watchman is a job.

287
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,120
It's a useful profession.

288
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,880
Aunt Georgette says that all professions are useful and honorable.

289
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,960
Even being a vice-president of a bank is a useful and honorable profession.

290
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,880
There's no such thing as a career leap, as my Aunt Georgette says.

291
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,500
Obviously, Mireille is being ironic when she says that.

292
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,440
She's mocking; she makes fun of the bank vice-presidents a little.

293
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,640
Mireille remains silent

294
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,280
She says nothing, she remains silent, she keeps quiet

295
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,900
Silence, silence, silence

296
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,500
Excuse me, I have to go home.

297
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,200
Mireille has to go home, she must go home.

298
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,760
She probably has work to do.

299
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,440
Mireille has to go home; it's not far, she lives very close by.

300
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:24,760
Robert and Mireille are at the Sorbonne and Mireille lives here, on rue de Vaugirard

301
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,860
It's not far, it's not far from the Sorbonne, it's very close.

302
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,380
The Eiffel Tower, yes, the Eiffel Tower, that's quite far away.

303
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,920
But Rue de Vaugirard is very close.

304
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,380
Is it far from your place? Would you mind allowing me to accompany you?

305
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,780
No, it's not far, it's very close to here.

306
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,080
And I'd be happy for you to accompany me.

307
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,120
As you say.

308
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,280
Mireille makes fun of Robert because he looks ceremonious.

309
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,360
He didn't say, "Can I come with you?"

310
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,960
But he said, would you allow me to accompany you?

311
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,140
It's very polite, but it's a little, a little ceremonious.

312
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,680
That's a ceremony.

313
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,860
That too is a ceremony.

314
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,200
A wedding is a ceremony.

315
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,100
And here is a very cerebral gentleman.

316
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,020
Mireille is frank. She says things directly.

317
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,540
I'm not bothering you.

318
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,320
Yes, you're boring me.

319
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,340
You can see that she's frank.

320
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,900
Frank, frank.

321
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,520
Actually, to be honest, I think you're quite nice.

322
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,900
Finally, I mean friendly.

323
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,080
Look, if you like, we can go sit for a few minutes in the Luxembourg Gardens.

324
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:57,820
They are going to sit on a bench. They sit down. It's the verb "to sit down." They sit down. Look at that man and that woman. They are going to sit down.

325
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:08,180
Mireille lives opposite the Senate and the Luxembourg Gardens.

326
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:16,440
The Senate is on one side of the street and Mireille lives opposite, on the other side of the street.

327
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,560
This lady and this gentleman are sitting opposite each other.

328
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,480
Here, Mireille and Robert are sitting next to each other.

329
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,020
Opposite, next door.

330
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,340
Oh dear, I forgot.

331
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,560
She forgot that she was supposed to take Marie-Laure to her dance class.

332
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,560
Marie-Laure also forgets sometimes.

333
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,680
Look here, she forgot what 9 x 6 equals.

334
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
9 x 6.

335
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
9 x 6.

336
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
I forgot.

337
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,440
Mireille has to take Marie-Laure to her dance class.

338
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,440
Look.

339
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,560
You are going to see Marie-Laure who is bringing Fido to Robert.

340
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,880
She brings Fido to Robert.

341
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,460
She brings it.

342
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,720
Robert writes a postcard to his mother.

343
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,300
The sun is setting.

344
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,320
The sun sets here too.

345
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,880
The sun sets here too.

346
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,900
And here, it's Marie-Laure who goes to bed.

347
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,800
The weather is very mild.

348
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,320
It's not cold.

349
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,020
It's not warm.

350
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,580
The weather is mild.

351
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,700
The weather is nice.

352
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,880
The temperature is mild.

353
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,680
Parisian women wear white sweaters and red skirts.

354
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,500
Robert is not a very objective observer.

355
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,980
Mireille lives in Paris. She is Parisian.

356
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,140
Hubert lives in Paris. He is Parisian.

357
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,000
This gentleman does not live in Paris. He is not from Paris.

358
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,200
Goodbye, Robert.

359
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,920
Robert blows kisses to his mother.

360
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,640
This is Rodin's kiss.

361
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,340
Here, Marie-Laure is giving her father a kiss.

362
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,840
Here, Marie-Laure is giving Aunt Georgette a kiss.

363
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,340
Here, Marie-Laure is giving Uncle Guillaume a kiss.

364
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,340
Here's a big kiss.

365
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,320
A kiss. Do you understand? Yes?

366
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,920
Here, sir, give the young lady a kiss.

367
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,560
May I, miss, learn French?

368
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,500
Yes? Then, sir, give her a kiss.

369
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,180
There you go! Very good, that's it. You understand.

370
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,500
You learn French very well.

371
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,600
Now Robert needs a stamp to send his card.

372
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,060
Do you have any stamps, please?

373
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,260
Here are some stamps.

374
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,940
Stamps.

375
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,220
You can buy stamps at the post office or at a tobacconist's.

376
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,680
Where can I buy stamps?

377
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,580
At a post office or a tobacconist's shop.

378
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,680
To buy stamps, you can go either to a tobacconist or to the post office.

379
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,980
The post office is after the bridge.

380
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,800
That's the bridge, the bridge to change.

381
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,240
That's the Pont Neuf.

382
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,160
And this is the Mirabeau Bridge.

383
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,100
That's a Roman bridge.

384
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,860
And that's a bridge from the Middle Ages.

385
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,460
This is the Avignon bridge.

386
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,140
That's a small bridge.

387
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,280
And this is a big bridge, the Tancarville bridge in Normandy.

388
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,240
Now, observe this carefully.

389
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,780
My mother is French, but my father didn't like France very much.

390
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,580
When I was little, we used to spend our holidays in Bermuda or Latin America, where my father had interests.

391
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,140
Were you spending your holidays in South America?

392
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,320
Loved, was, plane, had, passenger.

393
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,640
That's the past. That's the imperfect tense.

394
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,880
Let's see what you've learned. Look.

395
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,640
What number is it?

396
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,780
It's May 29th. Okay, now, what time is it? It's 11 o'clock.

397
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,500
Has Robert come to France often? No, this is the first time.

398
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,140
Does Mireille live alone? No, she lives with her parents.

399
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,440
Does Mireille live far from the Sorbonne? No, she lives very close by.

400
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Where can I buy stamps?

401
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,720
At the post office

402
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,540
Well, to be honest, I think that's enough as it is.

403
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,980
Goodbye everyone, see you next time

404
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,980
