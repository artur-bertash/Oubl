3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,760
Our five friends are gathered at the bike shop to talk about their trip.

4
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,580
So, where are we going?

5
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,400
Where are we going? Everywhere! We're going everywhere!

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,240
We're going to see the whole of France, as nature is celebrated there.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,940
2000 years of history and our 40 kings.

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
Your 40 kings and the sweat of the people, yes.

9
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,400
And what about the giants of '93?

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,600
Who are the giants of '93?

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,080
The great men of the French Revolution.

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,280
You know, Danton, Robespierre, great men, pure men, tough men.

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,720
Bloodthirsty monsters.

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,940
You absolutely must see our French countryside, which is as well-maintained as gardens.

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,060
our magnificent forests, our incomparable sites,

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,980
the Chamonix needles, the Cirque de Gavarnie,

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,380
the Verdon gorges and the Tarn gorges,

18
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,480
the calanques of Cassis, the Baux de Provence.

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,320
Above all, they need to see our cathedrals.

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,980
But I've already seen Notre-Dame.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,520
Do you think that once you've seen one, you've seen them all?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,960
We also saw Chartres

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,380
Two cathedrals, but that's nothing

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,040
There are hundreds of churches to see

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,960
Amiens and Sanef, Strasbourg and its spire

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,100
Reims, where all our kings were crowned

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,160
Bourges and its stained glass windows, Mont Saint-Michel and its wonder

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,260
And these tides that advance at the speed of a galloping horse

29
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,700
And Albi Cathedral with its enormous walls of small pink bricks

30
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,540
All the wonderful Romanesque churches

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,800
Vézelay, Paray-le-Monial, Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire, Poitiers, Conques, Saint-Nectaire.

32
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,580
Saint-Nectaire.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,020
Where they make the cheese.

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,380
All the fortified churches.

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,300
Agde, Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, Luse.

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,320
And all modern churches.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,660
Yvetot, the church of Plateau d'Assis, that of Cocteau, Royan, Ronchamps.

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,260
And then, you must see our castles.

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,420
Champs, Chambord, Chaumont, Chantilly.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,520
Chantilly.

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,360
The cream, whipped cream.

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,820
Châteaudun, Chenonceau, Chinon, Valençais.

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,880
Where they make goat cheese.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,960
Annay, Amboise, Angers, Azel Rideau, Blois, Fontaine Bleu.

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,020
Ah, blue fountain.

46
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,060
Cream cheese.

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,140
Loche, langer, pierre fond, saumur.

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,840
Saumur, where there is wine.

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,060
and one of the best cavalry schools in the world.

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,060
All of this seems very interesting, exciting, admirable to me.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,880
But it seems to me that's a lot.

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
We won't be able to go everywhere.

53
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,680
You know, France isn't very big.

54
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,400
Just one thousandth of the shepherds' land.

55
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,180
And shepherds, above the sea.

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,300
Obviously, if it's not above the sea, it's not land.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,660
France is slightly smaller than Texas.

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:59,280
But what variety, what richness! There's everything in France, yeah, but I was in the middle of...

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,280
We're going to be pretty cramped with 5 of us in your room, but Harry, we're going to have rusty joints

60
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,780
I wonder if it wouldn't be better to do that by bike, just to get some exercise. Oh yes.

61
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,040
Cycling in France wouldn't be bad; Cécile and her husband have already visited the Loire Valley castles.

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,560
cycling along the Loire when they were engaged and they found it wonderful, you have to

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,820
To say that the Loire Valley is a breeze, especially going downhill...

64
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:35,640
Climbing the Col du Tourmalet or the Col de l'Isran at 2770m is another matter entirely.

65
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,020
The thing is, we have mountains in France, the Alps, the Pyrenees, the

66
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,380
Jura, the Ardennes, the Vosges mountains, the Massif Central, and you're forgetting one

67
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,860
in Brittany.

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,300
Ah yes, the American massif.

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Armorican.

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,940
Armoricain, what is that?

71
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,540
It means Breton.

72
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,480
Armoric is Brittany.

73
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,880
Didn't they teach you that in geography class?

74
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, but it's not very high.

75
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,080
So it doesn't count.

76
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,420
Yes, there's no shortage of mountains.

77
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,460
And I absolutely insist

78
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,500
to go to the mountains.

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,900
I'm starting to get fed up

80
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,580
from the plain of Île-de-France.

81
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,140
Where is Île-de-France?

82
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,940
This is it. Paris, the provinces, it's in the Île-de-France region.

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,600
But it's not an island.

84
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,440
But it doesn't matter, that's what it's called.

85
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm fed up with the plains too. I'm sick of it. I want to go to the mountains.

86
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,560
Well, that's settled, no problem. We'll go to the Massif Central. My parents have a property in the Cantat.

87
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,400
Where is the cheese made?

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,500
Of course, the Massif Central is just a mountainous area for cows. Is that what you call a mountain?

89
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,180
You should at least go to the Pyrenees.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,580
The Pyrenees?

91
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,000
But there are no more Pyrenees, my dear friend.

92
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,560
There are no more Pyrenees?

93
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,720
Non.

94
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,760
Ah, another stupid thing from your Louis XIV.

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,660
Marie-Laure doesn't seem to understand.

96
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,720
But yes, you studied that in history, didn't you?

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,740
You know well the Peace of the Pyrenees, in 1659.

98
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,540
Louis XIV had signed a treaty with Spain.

99
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,980
And he said, there you go, now we're friends, buddies, buddies.

100
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,040
There is no longer a problem. Nothing separates France from Spain anymore.

101
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,920
It's as if the Pyrenees no longer exist.

102
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,360
There are no more Pyrenees. Ah, that's a good one.

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,220
This is the best of the year. The Pyrenees are no more.

104
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,780
Go ask a Tour de France rider,

105
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,460
when he tackles the Col d'Aubisque and the Col du Tourmalet in the same stage.

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,120
Note that, personally, if I had to choose, I think I prefer the Alps.

107
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,680
It's higher. La Meije, 3,983 meters.

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,300
Mont Blanc, 4,807 meters.

109
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:49,020
4,810, but come on Hubert, where did you get that from? Everyone knows that the

110
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:56,820
Mont Blanc is only 4800.7 m high, isn't it, Marie Laure? Mont Blanc altitude 4800

111
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:05,040
7m, you see, I was always taught 4810, I know that bad French who

112
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,240
They lacked a sense of grandeur; they tried to bring them down to 4807, but that

113
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,680
I will never accept cock-a-doodle-doo, let's talk less, let's talk more, where are we going? I propose we do the

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,360
Tour of France in a counter-clockwise direction, first stage Lille

115
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:30,240
Roubaix, Tourcoing, North, oh no, more plains, fields, mines, factories, what is it?

116
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Worth seeing, but the people, miss, the real France, the France that works, yes, but for

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,920
As far as gastronomy goes, the north isn't great.

118
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,980
If we started with Normandy, at least there, the food is good.

119
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:58,780
Camembert cheese, crème fraîche, Izigny butter, Norman sole, Rouen duck, tripe à la mode de Caen.

120
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,240
Go through Normandy!

121
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,240
While the young people were discussing their trip, the man in black appeared behind the window.

122
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,240
He's washing the windows. Weird, weird.

123
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,240
No one notices except Marie-Laure, who watches him, a little intrigued.

124
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Departure Monday morning at dawn. First stop Rouen.

125
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:35,740
no Tourcoing king Tourcoing king Tourcoing Rouen Tourcoing

126
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,920
The five friends are gathered to talk about their trip.

127
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,800
They are gathered. What is your name?

128
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,980
Mireille and Jean-Michel bring their kids together every Sunday.

129
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,860
They are having a meeting.

130
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,460
Here's a meeting.

131
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,860
That's a workers' meeting.

132
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,280
A meeting of cooks.

133
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,280
Where are we going? Where are we going?

134
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,260
Note that Hubert speaks better than Jean-Michel.

135
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,720
Where are we going? Where are we going?

136
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,100
Where are we going? That's more correct, more elegant.

137
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,220
Where are we going?

138
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,480
I know a pretty good little restaurant.

139
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,480
They will see France as nature made it.

140
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,200
The sea, the mountains, the plains, the rivers.

141
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,980
Nature shaped France, but so did history.

142
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,560
First, prehistory.

143
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:02,880
And then, the story that began more than 2000 years ago, with the Gauls and the Romans.

144
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,500
After the Gallo-Roman period, there were 40 kings.

145
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,280
According to Hubert, it was these kings who made France.

146
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,780
But Jean-Michel disagrees.

147
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,120
According to him, it was not the kings, but the work of the people that made France.

148
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,940
Your 43 and the sweat of the people, yes.

149
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,440
The sweat of the people means the work of the people.

150
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,440
When you work hard, you get hot, you sweat, you perspire.

151
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,820
According to Jean-Michel, it was the work of the people that made France.

152
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:56,000
And the giants of '93, the great men of the revolution in 1793, like Danton, Robespierre.

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,900
That's a normal man. That's a giant. And that's a dwarf.

154
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,660
Jean-Michel says they were figurative giants because he admires them. They are illustrious men.

155
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,000
Big ones, pure ones, tough ones.

156
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
Hubert disagrees.

157
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,640
Bloodthirsty monsters.

158
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,200
Hubert wants to show Robert the whole of France.

159
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,360
You absolutely must see our French countryside, which is as well-maintained as gardens.

160
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,200
The campaign.

161
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,400
The mountain.

162
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,680
The sea.

163
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,500
Our magnificent forests

164
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,580
Our incomparable sites

165
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,160
The Chamonix Needles

166
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,440
In the Alps, very sharp peaks like needles

167
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,280
The Cirque de Gavarnie

168
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,580
In the Pyrenees

169
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,000
The Verdon Gorge and the Tarn Gorge

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,880
The Verdon gorges, the Tarn gorges, now those are gorges!

171
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:15,940
Mireille, an art history specialist, mainly wants Robert to see the cathedrals.

172
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,840
The great Gothic cathedrals

173
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,700
Like the one in Amiens, which is famous for its very high nave

174
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,540
There you have it, a nave

175
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,420
Strasbourg Cathedral, famous for its spire

176
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,360
There, an arrow

177
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,680
An arrow

178
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,400
Reims Cathedral, famous for its angels

179
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,380
and because kings were crowned there.

180
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,240
Bourges Cathedral, famous for its stained glass windows.

181
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,840
Mont-Saint-Michel, which is famous for its Gothic church known as the Marvel

182
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,500
and also because there are very strong tides.

183
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,440
At the seaside, there are tides.

184
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,300
The sea is rising, it's high tide.

185
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,700
And then the sea goes out, it's low tide.

186
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:21,420
Here comes low tide. Low tide. At Mont-Saint-Michel, the tides are very strong. The sea rises very quickly, as fast as a galloping horse. There are all the Gothic churches from the 12th or 13th century.

187
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:36,580
And all the older Romanesque churches, Vézelay, Paray-le-Mognal, Conques, Saint-Nectaire.

188
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,620
Ah, Saint-Nectaire, that interests Colette, because there is a famous cheese there.

189
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,260
You also have to see all the fortified churches, like fortresses.

190
00:13:51,420 --> 00:14:16,820
Modern churches too, like the one in Yvetot in Normandy, the one in Poitiers, the one on the plateau of Assis in the Alps, the one in Royan on the Atlantic, the one in Ronchamps built by Le Corbusier.

191
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:36,280
And then, you have to see all the castles, the old castles that date back to the Middle Ages.

192
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:49,220
Angers, Loches, Chinon, Saumur, in the Loire region.

193
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,500
Saumur, where there is wine

194
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,280
Yes, Colette, there is also a very good wine in Saumur

195
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,380
And then, you have to see all the Renaissance castles

196
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,860
Amboise, where Leonardo da Vinci lived and died

197
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,480
Chambord

198
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,020
Chaumont

199
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,300
Chenonceau

200
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,760
Azé-le-Rideau

201
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,200
Angers, in the Loire region

202
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,120
And we mustn't forget Valençay

203
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,080
Where they make goat cheese

204
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,540
And Fontainebleau

205
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,840
Fontainebleau, the cream cheese

206
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,440
Et Chantilly

207
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,400
Chantilly, the Chantilly cream

208
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,660
Obviously, all of that adds up to a lot.

209
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,000
Fortunately, France is not very big.

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,460
Just one thousandth of the land has emerged.

211
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,180
To emerge?

212
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,020
No, Marie-Laure.

213
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,620
One thousand of the lands emerge.

214
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,380
To emerge, above the sea.

215
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,240
Emerge ?

216
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,860
Immerse.

217
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,540
Robert would prefer to make the journey by bicycle.

218
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,300
For what ?

219
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,100
Just to get some exercise.

220
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,660
He wants to exercise.

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,240
They exercise. They exercise too.

222
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,420
If you don't exercise, your joints will get stiff.

223
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,280
There it is, a joint. A rusty joint.

224
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,220
Cécile and her husband cycled around the Loire Valley castles when they were engaged.

225
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,300
But it must be said that the Loire Valley is easy going, especially going downhill.

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,380
However, to climb the Tourmalet or Iseran passes,

227
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,560
Two thousand seven hundred and seventy meters

228
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,260
That's another story.

229
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,860
That's another story, it's more difficult

230
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,400
Five times four

231
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,260
Twenty

232
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,440
Five times five

233
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,980
Twenty-five

234
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,780
Five times six

235
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,560
Thirty, that's all right.

236
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,180
Okay, and seven times four

237
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,760
Twenty-eight

238
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,880
Seven times five

239
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,800
Thirty-five

240
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,720
Okay, and nine times eight

241
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,280
Oh, that's a different story, it's not the same.

242
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,240
Cycling across France can be tough

243
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,520
because of the mountains.

244
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,720
That's because we have mountains of them in France.

245
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,680
That's because there are mountains of them.

246
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,520
Marie-Laure, please be kind and give me my glasses.

247
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,460
Where are they?

248
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,920
In one of the pockets of my jacket, right there.

249
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,900
Which one?

250
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
I don't know, look it up.

251
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,540
That's because there are pockets of them.

252
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,760
That's because there are pockets of them.

253
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,120
There are many mountains in France

254
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,500
Yes, there's no shortage of mountains.

255
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,320
The Alps

256
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,420
The Pyrenees

257
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,140
The Jura

258
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,380
The Vosges

259
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:09,140
The Massif Central

260
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,140
The Ardennes

261
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:23,580
The Armorican Massif

262
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,300
Armoricain, what is that?

263
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,240
It means Breton

264
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,980
It means Breton

265
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,920
Armoric is Brittany

266
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,620
I'm starting to get fed up with the plains of Île-de-France.

267
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Colette is fed up with the plains of Île-de-France.

268
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,100
Where is Île-de-France?

269
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,900
This is it. Paris, the provinces, it's in the Île-de-France region.

270
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,160
Listen to the conversation between Mireille and Marie-Laure, then you will play the role of Mireille.

271
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,700
Where is Île-de-France?

272
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Well, here. Paris, the provinces, it's in the Île-de-France region.

273
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,940
But it's not an island.

274
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,080
But it doesn't matter, that's what it's called.

275
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,540
Now it's your turn, you are Mireille.

276
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,780
Where is Île-de-France?

277
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Well, here, Paris, Provins, it's in the Ile de France.

278
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,900
Well, here, Paris, Provins, it's in the Ile de France.

279
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,720
Well, here, Paris, Provins, it's in the Ile de France.

280
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,980
But it's not an island.

281
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,100
But it doesn't matter, that's what it's called.

282
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,760
But it doesn't matter, that's what it's called.

283
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,780
But it doesn't matter, that's what it's called.

284
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,160
Jean-Michel is also fed up with the plains.

285
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,600
I'm fed up with the plains too.

286
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm fed up.

287
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,780
He's had enough, he's fed up, he's had it up to here.

288
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,340
There's a bowl, a full bowl, a bowl filled to the brim, he's had enough.

289
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Marie-Laure is fed up too.

290
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,880
I'm fed up, I'm sick and tired of homework and lessons.

291
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,580
Hey, I think I'll go for a drive to Luxembourg.

292
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,340
He wants to go mountaineering.

293
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,400
Hubert suggests Cantal, in the Massif Central.

294
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,040
Colette agrees, because there is a cheese specialty in Cantal.

295
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,480
But Jean-Michel disagrees.

296
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,600
Cantal is not real mountain country, it's cow country.

297
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,000
Now that's a real mountain. That's a cow pasture.

298
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,960
Jean-Michel suggests the Pyrenees.

299
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:42,220
"The Pyrenees? But there are no more Pyrenees, my dear friend."

300
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,000
Louis XIV abolished the Pyrenees.

301
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,700
Marie-Laure doesn't seem to understand. Yet it's quite simple.

302
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,520
The Pyrenees separate France from Spain.

303
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:02,880
There were wars, but in 1659, Louis XIV made a treaty with Spain.

304
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,920
The Peace of the Pyrenees

305
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,960
And he said

306
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,000
Now, nothing separates France and Spain

307
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,940
The Pyrenees no longer exist.

308
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,040
The Pyrenees no longer exist.

309
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,280
Non

310
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,800
Jean-Michel is not convinced

311
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,580
Ah, another stupid thing from your Louis XIV

312
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,420
It's a ridiculous joke

313
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,540
That's a good one!

314
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,080
This is the best one of the year

315
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,280
So Marie-Laure, you're not working?

316
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,520
That's a good one!

317
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,300
I slept with

318
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:38,600
A French assignment, a math assignment, a history lesson, a geography lesson, and I'm not working.

319
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
I swear, it's the best one of the year.

320
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,080
It wasn't me, it was him. That's the best one yet.

321
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,060
Ah, this is the best one of the year. There are no more Pyrenees.

322
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,260
Go ask the Tour de France riders when they tackle the Col d'Aubisque and the Col du Tourmalet in the same stage.

323
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,160
The Tour de France riders are tackling two mountain passes on the same day.

324
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,880
They are tackling two mountain passes in the same day.

325
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,480
And Marie-Laure has to do a whole lot of homework and lessons.

326
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,160
I had to do a French assignment, a math assignment,

327
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,140
A history lesson, a geography lesson, and I'm not working.

328
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,560
I swear.

329
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,440
Here's a mountain pass.

330
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,660
The Aubisque pass.

331
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,320
Jean-Michel prefers the Alps because they are higher

332
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,020
La Mège, 3,983 meters

333
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,620
Mont Blanc, 4,807 meters

334
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,740
Not everyone agrees on the altitude of Mont Blanc

335
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,300
4,807 meters, says Marie-Laure

336
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,600
4,807 meters

337
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,800
4 810

338
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,760
4,810 meters, says Hubert, who has a sense of grandeur

339
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,000
But come on, Hubert, where did you get that from?

340
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,140
Where did you get that from? That's not right.

341
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,400
Nine times eight.

342
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,400
Ninety-three.

343
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,700
Ninety-three? Where did you get that from?

344
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,200
Everyone knows that nine times eight equals seventy-two.

345
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,520
And that Mont Blanc only has...

346
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,260
Four thousand eight hundred and seven meters.

347
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,460
I was always taught four thousand eight hundred and ten.

348
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,120
I know that there were bad Frenchmen who lacked a sense of grandeur

349
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,260
tried to lower it to 4807.

350
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,100
But that, I will never accept.

351
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,160
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

352
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,640
What is the highest mountain in Europe?

353
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,900
I think it's Mont Blanc.

354
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,460
And do you know the altitude of Mont Blanc?

355
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,880
I learned that it was 4810 meters.

356
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:53,480
But I think there's a little less of it now, it's not as high.

357
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,660
Ah good ?

358
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:54,820
Yes.

359
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,440
Has it gone down?

360
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:56,900
A little.

361
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:05,240
Hubert suggests touring France in a counter-clockwise direction.

362
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,320
Clockwise, counter-clockwise.

363
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,000
You can clearly see the movement of the clouds; you see how they rotate in the direction of the movement of the chosen ones of the world in the northern hemisphere.

364
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
First stop, Roubaix-Tourcoing Island

365
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,720
But Colette disagrees, the north, no

366
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,040
More plains, fields, mines

367
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,520
Factories

368
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,600
She prefers Normandy

369
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,100
At least the food is good here

370
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,560
Camembert cheese, fresh cream

371
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:49,940
Izigny butter, Norman sole, Rouen duck, tripe à la mode de Caen.

372
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,780
Everyone agrees.

373
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,500
Let's go with the nun Andini.

374
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,120
If I were you, I would play the 10 of clubs.

375
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,060
I'll go with the 10 of clubs.

376
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,160
Let's go with the nun Andini.

377
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:18,380
They'll be heading out to the water Monday morning; the fishermen will be leaving very early, at dawn.

378
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:29,420
They leave at dawn, often there are shops that open at dawn, dawn, dawn, look

379
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:40,960
Listening and speaking, that's the sea or the mountains, the sea, the sea, yes, Louis XIV, he was a king or a

380
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:50,900
shepherd a king Notre Dame de Paris is a Romanesque or Gothic cathedral

381
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,580
Is that a Gothic or modern church?

382
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,320
Modern.

383
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,900
What are all these people doing?

384
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,860
They are exercising.

385
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,040
And him? Does he want to continue or is he fed up?

386
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,200
He's had enough. He's had enough. He's fed up.

387
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,040
What's wrong, Mr. Guignol? Is everything alright?

388
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,800
I've had enough. I'm fed up. I'm sick of it.

389
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,980
Well, come with us.

390
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,360
We're going to eat tripe à la mode de Caen.

391
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,860
These are the best tripe

392
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,100
Are you going to Lyon?

393
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,540
No, not in Normandy, in Caen.

394
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,040
You know very well that the best tripe is tripe à la mode de Caen.

395
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,340
Oh, that's a good one!

396
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,060
Where did you get that from?

397
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,560
The best tripe is tripe Lyonnaise style.

398
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,960
No, no, no, not in the camp style

399
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,160
In the Lyonnaise style, in the Lyonnaise style

400
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,980
In camp style

401

In the Lyonnaise style, in the Lyonnaise style, in the Lyonnaise style
