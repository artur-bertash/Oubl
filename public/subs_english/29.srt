2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,460
Watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,000
Pretty soon you will figure out what's going on

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,280
and be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,180
Robert is determined to find Mireille.

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,600
He rents a car and gets directions to Provence.

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,740
But he turns to follow a sports car

8
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,580
driven by a young woman who might be Mireille.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,760
By the time he realizes his mistake,

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,600
he is 300 kilometers off course,

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,500
lost in the wine country of Burgundy.

Subtitling by Radio-Canada

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,980
Towards the east, or rather the south, yes that's it, that's the southeast of Paris, it's not very far.

14
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Is this near Chartres?

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,420
Oh no, Chartres is towards the southwest, the province is above Fontainebleau, you know.

16
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,460
THANKS.

17
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you know where I could rent a car?

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh yes ?

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,340
Avis, Hertz, Europecar, Matéi.

20
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,420
Why do you want to rent a car?

21
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:08,700
Yes.

22
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,600
Go to the Shell garage, at the bottom of Aspaille Boulevard.

23
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,560
If you like, he's a friend.

24
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,240
Tell him you're coming from me.

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,400
THANKS.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,740
Hello Sir.

27
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:32,700
Good morning.

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,800
I am here on behalf of the owner of Home Latin.

29
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,080
I would like to rent a car for the day.

30
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,220
Yes, what do you want?

31
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,760
A big car, a small car,

32
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,920
Automatic or manual gear shifting?

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,280
Look, I have a brand new Renault 11 here,

34
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,820
with five synchronized floor-mounted speeds.

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,040
I also have a CX, with hydraulic suspension.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,880
It's very comfortable.

37
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,460
Oh, I don't care about that.

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Give me the cheapest one.

39
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,120
That R5 over there, for example.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Apparently, the R5s are the cheapest.

41
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,360
It's true ?

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm sorry, but it's not allocated.

43
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,560
I can't give it to you.

44
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,180
But if you want, I can give you a Peugeot 205.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,360
Is that the cheapest option you have?

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,640
Yes.

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:11,820
Good.

48
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,860
How much is it for the day?

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,880
450 francs.

50
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,820
Okay, I'll take it.

51
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,960
If you would be so kind as to give me your driver's license.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,320
Ah, an American driver's license.

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,820
A few minutes later, Robert is behind the wheel of the Peugeot.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,180
We're going to Fontainebleau, it's this way.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,940
Yes, go back up the boulevard in Spa, it's right there in front of you.

56
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,480
Are you familiar with Paris?

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,260
No, not really.

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,880
Here.

59
00:03:49,880 --> 00:04:13,700
Okay, I'll show you. You're here. Go up Boulevard Raspail to Denfert-Rochereau. You'll see, it's a square with a lion. Turn right onto Avenue du Général Leclerc. Follow it to Porte d'Orléans. And there, take the ring road on the left. Just follow the signs for the A6 motorway towards Lyon.

60
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,980
There are signs everywhere, there's no way to get lost.

61
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,180
You cannot get lost

62
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,180
Alright

63
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,040
Thank you, goodbye

64
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,840
Goodbye, have a good trip

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:36,580
Meanwhile, Mireille calls her uncle Guillaume

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,900
To borrow a car from him

67
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,000
Uncle? That's me, Mireille.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
Tell me, I have to go to Provins to see my friend Colette

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,200
You know, Colette Besson, could you lend me a car?

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,240
Yes, my dear Mireille, of course.

71
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,980
Take whichever one you want, it won't matter.

72
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
At CX?

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
Understood. Take it to the garage whenever you want.

74
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm going to call them to let them know.

75
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,600
Thank you, goodbye.

76
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,820
Meanwhile, Robert is walking up Boulevard Raspail.

77
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,180
He arrives at Hell-of-Horses Square.

78
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,140
The square with the lion,

79
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,360
veer to the right,

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:20,660
Take Avenue du Général Leclerc, follow it, follow it all the way to Porte d'Orléans, it should

81
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:28,940
To be here now, take the ring road on the left, the A6 motorway towards

82
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,660
In Lyon, there are signs everywhere, there's no way to get lost.

83
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,720
Three hours later, Robert is completely lost

84
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,540
300 kilometers from Easter, in the heart of Burgundy.

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,300
He asks for directions.

86
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,040
Excuse me, sir, is the road to Paris this way?

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,680
You're mistaken, young man. The road to Paris is to the right, over there.

88
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,080
There, over there, that's Marcon. There, you're lost.

89
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,600
This is what happened.

90
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,300
In Fontainebleau, he wanted to get off the highway

91
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,700
to go back up towards Provins.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,600
Just as he was exiting the interchange, he saw an Alpine with a blonde woman inside who

93
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Robert was heading onto the motorway towards Lyon when he immediately turned around and started

94
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,980
In pursuit, Robert accelerates at full throttle, but the Alpine refuses to let him pass.

95
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Just before Beaune, the Alpine stops for Andolescence.

96
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Fill up with premium gasoline, please.

97
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,360
The blonde woman gets out of the car and heads towards the toilets.

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,360
That's not good.

99
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:10,780
Disgusted, Robert exits the highway

100
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,200
and will get lost in the Burgundy vineyards.

101
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,460
Alox, Corton.

102
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,600
Night, Saint-Georges.

103
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,540
Vaux-le-Romalais.

104
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,580
Rougeau.

105
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,400
Chambol-Musigny.

106
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,100
Gevrey-Chambertin.

107
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Fixed.

108
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:41,300
Last time, Robert wanted to go to dinner with Mireille on a riverboat.

109
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,900
But she said she wasn't free, that she was going to a friend's house on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

110
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,620
Robert took a taxi and went to Saint-Germain to try and find Mireille.

111
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,460
He didn't find it.

112
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,940
He slept badly.

113
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,900
He's not in good shape.

114
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,980
Look at Jean-Claude here, he's not in good shape.

115
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,080
Yes, he's in good shape here. He's in top form.

116
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,000
In shape, not in shape.

117
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,040
Not in good shape.

118
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,440
In shape, not in shape.

119
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,180
In shape, in shape, not in shape.

120
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,520
They look to be in good shape.

121
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,440
But they don't look to be in good shape.

122
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,120
I have a crushed one.

123
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,720
Oh, you don't look well.

124
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,360
Robert asks where Provins is.

125
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,440
This is the southeast of Paris.

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,620
North, west, south, east, southeast.

127
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,060
It's near Chartres.

128
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,680
Oh no, Chartres is towards the southwest.

129
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,860
Provins is near Fontainebleau.

130
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,720
Are you familiar with Fontainebleau?

131
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,300
There is a beautiful forest and a beautiful castle.

132
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,780
Provins is not far away.

133
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,480
Let's ask someone where Provins is.

134
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,800
Is it far from Paris?

135
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,440
I would say about a hundred kilometers east of Paris.

136
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,700
It is 90 kilometers east of Paris on the road to Troyes.

137
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,300
Is this near Chartres?

138
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,640
No, not really, no.

139
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,640
Oh no, not at all, it's in the opposite direction.

140
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,700
According to the hotel owner, it's a little above Fontainebleau.

141
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,760
It's above Fontainebleau.

142
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,120
Above, below.

143
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,580
Above, below.

144
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,780
Look.

145
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,840
Mireille lives on this floor.

146
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,980
That's the floor above.

147
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,540
And that's the floor below.

148
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,360
Robert wants to rent a car.

149
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,360
To go to Provins, obviously.

150
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,580
The hotel owner recommended a garage on Boulevard Raspail.

151
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,240
Because the garage owner is a friend.

152
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,020
Go to the Shell garage, it's at the bottom of Boulevard Raspail.

153
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,340
Down, up.

154
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,840
Down, up.

155
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,100
Down, up.

156
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,440
Down, up.

157
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,780
Up, down.

158
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,380
Where is Raymond?

159
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:19,800
He is at the top.

160
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,060
Down, up.

161
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
Up, down.

162
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,080
At the very top of the Pyrenees mountain range, at the foot of the Vignomal massif, lies Lake Gaube.

163
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,180
Go to the Shell garage. It's at the bottom of Boulevard Raspail. You can go there on my behalf.

164
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,420
That's what Robert does. He says he's there on behalf of the hotel owner.

165
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,040
Hello Sir.

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:43,920
Good morning.

167
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,480
I am here on behalf of the owner of the Latin home.

168
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,800
From. Observe.

169
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Hello? Yes, you've reached Mr. Bello's?

170
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Yes, I can see if he's there. Who's calling?

171
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Mr. Charpentier. Very well. Don't hang up.

172
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Dad, this is for you! Mr. Carpenter speaking!

173
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Robert is here on behalf of his hotel owner.

174
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,120
The owner is the boss. You can own a hotel,

175
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,260
One can own a house and a garden.

176
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,620
One can own a car.

177
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,800
Observe this scene.

178
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,620
You are going to see a worried car owner.

179
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,560
This is your car, number 11 027 SK 94.

180
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,320
11 027 SK 94.

181
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,180
Do you know the owner?

182
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,380
Robert can choose between a big car or a small car.

183
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,780
A big car, a small car.

184
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,940
And a very small car.

185
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,200
A big car, a small car.

186
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,920
Robert can choose between automatic or manual gear shifting.

187
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,580
That's a manual, floor-mounted gear shift.

188
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:17,120
The mechanic recommended a CX, a Citroën car that has hydraulic suspension.

189
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,660
It's very comfortable.

190
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,920
Comfortable, look, the floor, it's not very comfortable, it's hard

191
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,400
A sofa is more comfortable

192
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,120
A bench is less comfortable than a sofa

193
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,740
An iron chair isn't very comfortable.

194
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,660
But two chairs are more comfortable

195
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,120
And a deckchair is even more comfortable

196
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,360
But comfort is not what interests Robert.

197
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,340
Comfort is irrelevant to him.

198
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,200
He doesn't care.

199
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,760
Robert wants the cheapest car.

200
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,080
A 2CV, for example, or an R5.

201
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,320
These are the cheapest cars.

202
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,220
The mechanic does have an R5, but it is not allocated.

203
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,680
I'm sorry, it's not allocated.

204
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,800
Listen to what Marie-Laure says, who doesn't want to sell her last chocolate.

205
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,820
Give me a chocolate.

206
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,960
I only have one left.

207
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,220
I'll buy it from you.

208
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,140
How much?

209
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,360
50 cents.

210
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,860
I'm sorry. This chocolate is not for sale. I'm keeping it.

211
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,700
The mechanic is offering a Peugeot 205.

212
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,480
It's more expensive than a 2CV or an R5, but it's the cheapest one he has.

213
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,600
Is that the cheapest option you have?

214
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:40,920
Yes.

215
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,020
The Citroën is the most comfortable car he has.

216
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,740
The Alpine is the fastest car he has.

217
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,740
The R5 is the cheapest option.

218
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,360
How much is it for the day?

219
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,020
450 francs.

220
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,060
Okay, I'll take it.

221
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:58,880
Alright.

222
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,580
If you would be so kind as to give me your driver's license.

223
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,060
Ah, an American driver's license.

224
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,040
That's a French driving licence.

225
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,620
Listen carefully to this conversation between the garage owner and Robert.

226
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,440
Then, you will answer the mechanic as if you were Robert.

227
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,960
I'm sorry, but it's not allocated. I can't give it to you.

228
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,060
If you want, I can give you a Peugeot 205.

229
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,740
That's the cheapest option you have.

230
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,100
Yes.

231
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,480
Okay, that's fine. How much is it for the day?

232
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,060
450 francs.

233
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,620
Okay, I'll take it.

234
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,300
Now, answer as if you were Robert.

235
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm sorry, but it's not allocated. I can't give it to you.

236
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,340
If you want, I can give you a Peugeot 205.

237
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,560
That's the cheapest option you have.

238
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,320
That's the cheapest option you have.

239
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,260
That's the cheapest option you have.

240
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:53,960
Yes.

241
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,920
Okay, that's fine.

242
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,660
How much is it for the day?

243
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,240
Okay, that's fine.

244
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,300
How much is it for the day?

245
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,540
Okay, that's fine.

246
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,740
How much is it for the day?

247
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,680
450 francs.

248
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,500
Okay, I'll take it.

249
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,040
Okay, I'll take it.

250
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,640
Okay, I'll take it.

251
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,140
Okay, so, in the end, Robert takes the 205.

252
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,080
It's a small Peugeot car.

253
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,780
In France, there are many small cars.

254
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,040
What kind of car do you have?

255
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,940
I have a Peugeot 304, a French car.

256
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,540
Is it a big car?

257
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,240
No, small car.

258
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Is it a car with an automatic transmission?

259
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,220
No, manual gear shifting.

260
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,240
I have a 104 that is 12 years old, like a good whisky.

261
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,060
Is it a big car?

262
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,420
It's a small car that serves me very well in Paris, and it runs very well.

263
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,140
Let's get back to Robert. He is now driving the 205.

264
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,460
The steering wheel.

265
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,300
A young woman driving a bus

266
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,860
Robert asks the garage owner for directions

267
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,680
He asks how to get to Fontainebleau

268
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,740
Fontainebleau, yes, because he knows that Provins is next to Fontainebleau

269
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,360
To get to Fontainebleau, it's this way.

270
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,680
Okay, to understand the mechanic's explanations, we need to review a few terms.

271
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,720
First, a boulevard, this is Boulevard Raspail

272
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:45,760
Boulevard Saint-Michel, Boulevard Saint-Germain. There's also a ring road. It's a boulevard that goes around Paris. And then there are the avenues that resemble boulevards.

273
00:17:45,760 --> 00:18:02,200
This, for example, is General Leclerc Avenue. The Champs-Élysées is also an avenue, a very grand, very wide avenue. Here's another avenue. And then there are the streets. A street, a small street, an old street.

274
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,440
And then there are the seats

275
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,280
Place Saint-Michel, Place de la Sorbonne

276
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,500
Place de la Concorde, Place Vendôme

277
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Place de la Bastille, Place de l'Étoile

278
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,320
Place Saint-Sulpice, a square in the provinces

279
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,000
Another place in the provinces, another place

280
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,320
And outside the cities, there are the roads and highways.

281
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:38,560
To get on or off a motorway, there are interchanges.

282
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:47,060
Here's an interchange, a motorway exit to go to Fontainebleau. Robert needs to take

283
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:54,260
To get to motorway 6, he has to go up Boulevard Raspail.

284
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,900
Here are some cars driving up the Champs-Elysées.

285
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:07,160
You need to follow Boulevard Aspaille to Place d'Enfer-Rochereau

286
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,300
Here, you need to turn right, turn slightly to the right.

287
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,380
There's a car veering to the right.

288
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,700
At Porte d'Orléans, you need to take the ring road to the left, that is to say, towards the east.

289
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,140
towards the A6 motorway which goes to Lyon.

290
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,340
Fortunately, there are signs everywhere.

291
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,380
You can't get lost.

292
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,760
It is impossible to get lost.

293
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,340
There's no way to get lost.

294
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,700
There are signs everywhere.

295
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,520
There's no way to go wrong.

296
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,700
You can't get lost.

297
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,660
It's impossible. There's no way.

298
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,780
Observe this scene where Mireille doesn't arrive

299
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,460
to open a jar of jam.

300
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm sorry, there's no way to open it.

301
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,180
There must be a way.

302
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,120
I'm telling you there's no way.

303
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,900
I've tried everything.

304
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,820
You see, there was a way.

305
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,300
Where there's a will, there's always a way.

306
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,540
Of course, where there's a will, there's always a way.

307
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,680
Robert always manages to get lost.

308
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,340
Look at him. He's completely lost in the middle of Burgundy.

309
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,400
This is what happened.

310
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,700
He was exiting the motorway at Fontainebleau

311
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,100
when he saw a red Alpine with a young blonde girl inside.

312
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,380
He turned around.

313
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,180
One turn, one half turn.

314
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,180
The car turns around.

315
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,580
They turn around

316
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:55,920
Robert turned around and set off in pursuit of the Alpine.

317
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,020
He's following the Alpine; it's a chase.

318
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,760
He rushes forward, he goes as fast as he can

319
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,740
He hurries, he rushes

320
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,040
He rushes forward

321
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,700
Go for it, go for it!

322
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,620
Robert is speeding along at full throttle.

323
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,100
He presses the accelerator all the way down, to the maximum.

324
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,840
Robert tries to overtake the Alpine.

325
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,860
Look, we're not going fast, all the cars are passing us.

326
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,360
Watch the taxi, it's going to overtake the small car.

327
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,600
Near Beaune, in Burgundy, the Alpine stops at a service station to get gas.

328
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,840
Fill up with premium gasoline, please.

329
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,860
You can ask for 10 litres, 20 litres or, generally, a full tank.

330
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,700
The dish, please

331
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,420
The dish, please

332
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,280
Right away, miss

333
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,000
At gas stations, there are two types of gasoline

334
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,200
Regular and premium gasoline

335
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,440
Super petrol is more expensive than regular petrol

336
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,200
When Robert sees that the blonde girl is not Mireille

337
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,480
He is disgusted, he is sickened.

338
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,460
and he will get lost in the vineyards of Burgundy,

339
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,520
in Lox-Corton, Nuit-Saint-Georges, etc.

340
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,660
Meanwhile, Mireille borrows a car from Uncle Guillaume.

341
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,640
Could you lend me a car?

342
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,860
Mireille borrows the car, and her uncle lends his car.

343
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:37,820
Observe.

344
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,460
Hey, you're rich, can you lend me 50 francs?

345
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,080
Will you give them back to me?

346
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,100
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty and fifty.

347
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,920
THANKS.

348
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,660
Here, the fifty francs I borrowed from you yesterday.

349
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,520
THANKS.

350
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,140
In this scene, Mireille borrows fifty francs and Marie-Laure lends fifty francs.

351
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,380
Mireille borrows her car from Uncle Guillaume.

352
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,480
And Uncle Guillaume lends him his car.

353
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,380
Uncle Guillaume is going to phone the garage to let them know that Mireille is going to take her car.

354
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,520
He's going to warn the garage.

355
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,180
You should always call to let us know.

356
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,580
Look.

357
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,340
I'll let you know so that someone can be sent here to keep an eye on your house.

358
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,720
Warning, this is more serious.

359
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,640
It was the police who needed to be notified.

360
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,080
And so in fact, your friend Bailly died on June 25, 1973.

361
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,620
Do you know what time?

362
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,500
At 8:17 a.m.

363
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,800
I know, I was there.

364
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,040
I looked at my watch at that moment, instinctively.

365
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,040
And it was me who alerted the police to this stupid accident.

366
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,580
In serious cases, the police should always be notified.

367
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,140
If you don't hear from me in a half-war, you notify the police.

368
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,040
Let's see what you have to say.

369
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,700
Listen, think, and speak.

370
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Look at Robert. Is he in good shape or not?

371
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
He's not in good shape.

372
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:20,700
In your opinion, is Provins more southeast or northwest of Paris?

373
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
To the southeast.

374
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:29,700
On the map, is Provins above or below Fontainebleau?

375
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Above.

376
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,440
You are Mireille. You answer the phone.

377
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,280
This is someone who wants to speak to Mr. Bello.

378
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,700
What are you asking?

379
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,580
What did you say?

380
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,940
Who is this from?

381
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,620
Again.

382
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,080
Who is this from?

383
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,700
What is that? The gear shift or the steering wheel?

384
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,840
The steering wheel.

385
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,700
And is that the gear shift or the brake?

386
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,320
The gear change.

387
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,320
In your opinion, is this a highway or a road?

388
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,280
A highway.

389
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,340
In your opinion, are these cars going down the Champs-Élysées or up it?

390
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,680
They pull them up.

391
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,120
According to the mechanic, why is it impossible to make a mistake?

392
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,580
Because there are signs everywhere.

393
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,480
What is Robert doing?

394
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,180
He turns around.

395
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,680
Do you need petrol or premium?

396
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,360
What are you saying?

397
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,960
Fill up with premium gasoline, please.

398
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,860
Mireille wants to go to Provins.

399
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,160
She doesn't have a car.

400
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,200
What is she asking Uncle Guillaume?

401
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,900
She asks him to lend her a car.

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,080
You have an appointment with Mireille.

403
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,500
You can't go there.

404
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,820
What needs to be done?

405
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,680
We need to warn her.

406
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Hello, Mr. Guignol. I'm here on behalf of Mr. Dupont.

407
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Mr. Dupont doesn't know.

408
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
It's for renting a car.

409
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Do you want to rent a car?

410
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Yes, Mr. Guignol, I want to rent a car.

411
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,680
I'm trying to melt your heart. That's a very beautiful car.

412
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Comfortable, fast, sunroof, four wheels.

413
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,000
Roux, it holds up very well.

414
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,240
You steer a steering wheel with your little finger.

415
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,300
Hood, engine, brrrr, brrrr.

416
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,480
Front chew, back chew, everything.

417
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,640
How much is it?

418
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,820
1000 francs per day.

419
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,140
Okay, I'll take it.

420
