and absorb it.

3
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,660
Very soon, you will see what happens

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,120
and you will be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,580
All marbles players go through,

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,060
of Uncle William who lost his fortune

7
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,760
to Uncle Georgette who won a battery in the lottery.

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,740
She went to the Taj Mahal with the one who left.

9
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,600
The man in black leaves tantalizing notes on Mireille.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,560
Mireille, Robert, Colette, Hubert and Jean-Michel settle down on the terrace of the two mornings.

11
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
It's a strange idea to come here for a drink.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,920
Don't you think that's a bit snobbish?

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,960
Not at all, I find it perfectly natural.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,500
Look, this is a meeting place for the intellectual elite, and it's part of

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,180
Robert's education is a historic café, doesn't it bother you to think that

16
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,340
You might be sitting in Jean-Paul Sartre's chair, yes, yes, yes, I've already sat in it.

17
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,980
on Hemingway's chair at the Closerie des Lilas, my posterior is very honored, I'm going to have a

18
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:56,340
Well-rubbed-over posterior of literature, boy, yes sir, a corked bottle of cider if you

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,660
I'm sorry, we don't have any, sir. Miss would like a bottle of cider, since...

20
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,420
I'm telling you, we don't have any, sir. Figure it out yourself and find us some cider.

21
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:11,280
Normandy at that moment Mireille, who was facing the boulevard, wrote, "How curious!"

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Yes, it's Jean-Pierre himself. What are you doing here? Did you come for a drink with him?

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,380
No, thank you, I'm sorry, but I can't, I'm in a hurry, there's a gorgeous girl waiting for me.

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Club Med in Martinique, I have to hurry or I'll miss my flight, ciao, and he's leaving and

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:42,740
Well, this one hasn't changed, still as smelly as ever. Hey, look, this isn't

26
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,460
Your godmother, that lady with the cat, little kitty, what are you doing here? You passed by

27
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,240
Your exams? Did you pass? You see, I'm putting the kitty away for boarding. We're celebrating tonight for the

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,280
Bulgaria, it seems it's wonderful. I'm going to do a yogurt cleanse. Unfortunately, they don't have any.

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,360
wanted to give Minouche her visa. She's going to be bored, poor darling, all alone in Paris. You'd like

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,280
Not going to see her from time to time? Oh no, I'm sorry, I won't be able to. We're all leaving

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,020
Tomorrow morning at dawn. So, this bottle of cider. Yes, sir, I'll take care of it. Cider.

32
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,020
And the boy heads towards another table.

33
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,020
Hey, no way, it's Guylaine!

34
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,020
Guylaine, where are you going like that?

35
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,020
I'm going to England, to Brighton.

36
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Bruce is waiting for me. Bye, I'll send you postcards.

37
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Our Cider!

38
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,020
Right away, sir, I'll bring it to you.

39
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,020
Hey, isn't that your sister over there?

40
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,020
on this magnificent 10-speed racing bike?

41
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,020
Yes, it's Cécile and her husband.

42
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,020
What a surprise and what a coincidence!

43
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Cécile, are these your bikes?

44
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Yes, we just bought them at BHV. We're leaving for Portugal tomorrow.

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,020
By bike?

46
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
By bicycle.

47
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Bring me back a bottle of Port. I'll pay you back.

48
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
It seems he had nothing to do with it there.

49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,020
This cider! We're starting to get thirsty.

50
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,020
One minute, sir.

51
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Oh, that's wonderful, Uncle Victor.

52
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
One of your uncles or something?

53
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Over there, in the small horse-drawn carriage that just stopped at the red light.

54
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,180
just stopped at the red lights with the sofas among the suitcases on the gallery and

55
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,480
Uncle Victor, are you going to Brest? No, I'm going to Bordeaux. It's a shame they're not going.

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,540
In Brittany, we could have asked him to bring us back this bottle of cider.

57
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:35,220
Oh no, I'm sticking with my Normandy cider, tell me, waiter, this cider is coming, but

58
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,460
Certainly, sir, how curious, how strange, but yes, it's Uncle Guillaume.

59
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,580
In this old clunker, and Uncle Guillaume, what did you do? You have 604, I sold them, yes

60
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm ruined, my poor little Mireille, I lost everything at the roulette table in the Monte Carlo casino.

61
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:01,380
I have nothing left, I need a change of scenery, I'm going to start my life over, I'm leaving for Kathmandu

62
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,920
Yes, it seems you can live there for next to nothing.

63
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,080
Poor Uncle Guillaume, do you want me to lend you my sleeping bag?

64
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,440
No, thank you, you're kind.

65
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,840
There's no point. I'm off.

66
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,300
Hey, I think I recognize those beautiful, muscular legs.

67
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,640
Where? Where is it?

68
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,060
There, the guy on the Solex bikes.

69
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,700
What did he do with his Alpine 310?

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,260
Yes, but he never owned an Alpine.

71
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,040
He's broke as a rake. He doesn't have a penny to his name.

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,160
Hey Fersen, where are you going like that?

73
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,380
I'm leaving for Greece.

74
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Delphi, the theatre of Epidorus, the Parthenon.

75
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,820
And you, you're leaving, right?

76
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,900
Yes, tomorrow at dawn.

77
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,080
As soon as we've drunk our cider.

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,180
Cheers, Skoll.

79
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,660
So, how was the cider?

80
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,700
Yes, yes, it's coming.

81
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,400
Hey, put me through. Tell me I'm dreaming.

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,080
But that's not possible.

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,420
No, there's no mistake, it's definitely her

84
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,280
But who?

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,640
Yes, it's her.

86
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,840
But who?

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,180
But there, in the pale blue convertible

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,180
With sunglasses and a large Balenciaga scarf

89
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,880
But who, exactly?

90
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,200
But you can't see that?

91
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,060
In the convertible, next to the handsome, tanned, dark-haired guy

92
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,440
With the silk shirt from Bronzini

93
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,060
And the black beard and the dark glasses

94
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,680
Well, that handsome dark-haired man is in trouble.

95
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,000
But who is this girl?

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,560
But the girl, the girl, don't you recognize her?

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,980
That's my Aunt Georgette, you see.

98
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,680
No, not possible.

99
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,580
Yes, I assure you.

100
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,880
Mireille gets up and approaches the convertible.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh, oh, Mireille.

102
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,460
You'll never guess what's happening to me.

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,320
I'll give you a thousand guesses.

104
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,580
Since I'll never guess, just tell me right now.

105
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,620
Comment ?

106
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,620
But didn't you read it in the newspapers?

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,020
I won the lottery jackpot.

108
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,100
That's not true.

109
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,780
But how so?

110
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,240
Are you buying tickets now?

111
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you think so? I haven't bought any for a long time.

112
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
I never won.

113
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,440
This is a ticket that Fido found while I was walking him along the Luxembourg Gardens fence.

114
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,080
Oh, that's a funny number.

115
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,320
Nothing but brand new ones.

116
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
99, 999, 999.

117
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,880
He won 500,000 bucks for that number.

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,880
And the next day, I met up with Georges.

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,880
We are going to live our lives in the East.

120
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
We are going to India.

121
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,880
We're going to get engaged at the Taj Mahal.

122
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Then we will go to Iran to breathe in the roses of Ispan.

123
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,880
None of this is intoxicating.

124
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
She's going to get engaged at the Taj Mahal.

125
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,540
At his age? That's insane.

126
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,160
So, boy, this Norman cider.

127
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,040
Here it is, sir.

128
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:58,960
Finally!

129
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,180
Not a moment too soon. We almost had to wait, as Louis XIV would say.

130
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,160
Better late than never, as my Aunt Georgette would say.

131
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,260
Everything comes to those who wait, as my mother would say.

132
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,380
Give us that bottle quickly. We'll open it ourselves.

133
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,880
Challenge yourself, it's sparkling wine, sir.

134
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,340
Here, Robert, the honor is yours.

135
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,280
Be careful not to pop the cork, okay?

136
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,580
Take it easy.

137
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,540
Robert approaches the cork with infinite but still insufficient care.

138
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:35,620
The cork hits a gentleman squarely in the forehead, who gets up and runs away hastily, knocking over two or three chairs.

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:44,840
And leaving on his table a cup of black coffee, dark glasses and a notebook from which several photos escape.

140
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:53,400
And the pages are filled with notes. At the top of the first page, one can read Mireille Belleau, 18 rue de Vaugirard, Paris 6th, art history student.

141
00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Watch out, she does karate. We absolutely must catch her alone as soon as possible. Unfortunately, she's almost always accompanied by a tall, dark-haired young man.

142
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,800
Attack plan? Unfortunately, the rest of the notes are completely indecipherable.

143
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,220
Mireille, Robert and the others crossed the church square

144
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,740
To go and sit on the terrace of Les Deux Magots

145
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,900
The Café des Deux Magots opposite the Saint-Germain-des-Prés church

146
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,360
Everyone knows that

147
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,760
It's a strange idea to come here for a drink.

148
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
They have a drink

149
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,300
They have a drink

150
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,980
A jar of jam

151
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,800
And a jar of mustard

152
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,180
A pot of paint

153
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,280
A pot of grease and a flower pot.

154
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,680
A pot is a glass.

155
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,740
She takes a drink.

156
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,640
He has a drink in a bistro.

157
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,960
All these people are taking potlucks from the two Magots.

158
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,780
According to Jean-Michel, "Les deux magots" sounds snobbish.

159
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,380
Don't you think that's a bit snobbish?

160
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,260
Going to La Closerie des Lilas, to Les Deux Magots, is snobbish.

161
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,600
A Rolls Royce too, that's snobbish.

162
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,120
An alpine bike looks sporty.

163
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,380
A candlelit dinner is romantic.

164
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,900
This hairstyle, this makeup, it's punk.

165
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,240
Kissing hands is a bit old-fashioned.

166
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,520
Look at Uncle Guillaume.

167
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,360
He looks very young.

168
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,500
Madame Belleau also looks very young.

169
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,060
Jean-Michel thinks that the two magots are snobbish.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
Hubert disagrees.

171
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,660
Not at all, I find it perfectly natural

172
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,240
Look, this is a gathering of the intellectual elite

173
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,200
And besides, it's part of Robert's upbringing; it's a historic café.

174
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,080
Uncle Guillaume is part of the family

175
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,960
But Delapierre, Georges' math teacher, is not part of the family.

176
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,980
Aunt Georgette is part of the family

177
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,280
But Jean-Pierre is not part of the family

178
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
Fortunately

179
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,120
And is he part of the family?

180
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,480
No, he is not part of the family.

181
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,540
He's part of the rugby team.

182
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:24,340
Learning to read, doing math, physics, history, geography, all of that is part of education.

183
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,060
Going to De Mago is part of Robert's education.

184
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,360
It's a historic cafe.

185
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,780
Thinking that you are sitting in Jean-Paul Sartre's chair, that's something.

186
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,680
Doesn't it bother you to be ten years old?

187
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,360
Yes, it would affect me.

188
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,780
When this lady sees her little boy bringing her a cake, it does something to her, she is moved.

189
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,920
That makes me happy.

190
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,660
When Robert visited Chartres Cathedral and saw a ray of light on Mireille's blond hair,

191
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,280
"Ah, that affected him."

192
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,360
I have already sat in Hemingway's chair at the Closerie des Lilas.

193
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,380
My posterior is very honored.

194
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,660
My backside is going to be thoroughly rubbed with literature.

195
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,520
Robert is going to get a good dose of literature.

196
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,600
Scrubbed. That's a well-scrubbed saucepan.

197
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,980
And here's a lady cleaning her windows.

198
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,940
And here's a piece of bread rubbed with garlic.

199
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:34,220
To make pancakes, you need a pan rubbed with fat, oil or butter.

200
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,120
When Robert sits down, he sits on his backside.

201
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,640
A kick in the backside.

202
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,260
And he fell on his backside.

203
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,180
The buttocks.

204
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,700
The buttocks.

205
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,780
Hubert orders a bottle of cider.

206
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,280
"Waiter, a corked bottle of cider, please."

207
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
"I'm sorry, we don't have any, sir."

208
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,840
"Miss would like a bottle of cider."

209
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,940
"But I'm telling you, we don't have any, sir."

210
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,620
"Figure it out yourselves, find us some cider. From Normandy!"

211
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,080
Now listen to the dialogue between the boy and Hubert, then you will take on the role of Hubert.

212
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,820
"Waiter, a corked bottle of cider, please."

213
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,120
"Waiter, a corked bottle of cider, please."

214
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,900
Waiter, a corked bottle of cider, please. Sir, I'm sorry.

215
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,720
We don't have any, figure it out yourselves, find us some cider, figure it out yourselves

216
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:41,240
We have cider, figure it out yourselves, find us some cider, it's just at that moment

217
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,960
Who is that person walking on the sidewalk? Jean-Pierre Bourdon. He has an appointment at

218
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,660
Club Med at Club Méditerranée, well, that one hasn't changed.

219
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:58,680
Still as smelly as ever, and that lady who walks by, but it's Madame Courtois, she

220
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,320
going on a yogurt cleanse in Bulgaria if you have liver problems, you can

221
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm thinking of doing a mineral water cure or a yogurt cure.

222
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
Unfortunately, he didn't want to give me a yogurt treatment.

223
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,700
Minouche's visa, she's going to be bored, poor darling, all alone in Paris.

224
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,260
Won't you want to wash them from time to time?

225
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,020
Oh no, I'm sorry, I won't be able to.

226
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
We are all leaving tomorrow morning at dawn.

227
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,460
They will leave at dawn, very early in the morning.

228
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,000
Here comes the dawn.

229
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,700
It's hard to get up at dawn.

230
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,560
And these two young people are Cécile and Jean-Denis

231
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,920
who ride by on magnificent racing bikes.

232
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,320
A bicycle, a bicycle, a mini-bike, a racing bike.

233
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,400
Cécile and Jean-Denis

234
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,600
have just bought

235
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,480
These bikes. Yes, we just bought them

236
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,380
At BHV. We're leaving for Portugal tomorrow.

237
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,700
Colette asks them to bring her back

238
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,960
a bottle of Port.

239
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,020
Bring me back a bottle of Port.

240
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,180
I will reimburse you. Colette

241
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,580
will easily repay

242
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,400
Port wine, since it seems

243
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,180
that it costs almost nothing

244
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,420
in Portugal. Apparently he is

245
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,080
for nothing there.

246
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,980
And now, one of Mireille's uncles is passing by.

247
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,960
His uncle Victor, do you remember him?

248
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,220
The one who is slightly cross-eyed

249
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,600
His right eye is looking towards Brest

250
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,880
His left eye is looking towards Bordeaux

251
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,020
Hey, Uncle Victor, are you going to Brest?

252
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,140
No, I'm going to Bordeaux

253
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,100
He's in an old Citroën 2CV.

254
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,720
with a whole load of luggage on the roof rack

255
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,960
When you no longer have room in the trunk

256
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,620
You can put your belongings on the gallery

257
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:51,960
a gallery, a gallery on his gallery, Uncle Victor has fishing rods for

258
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,800
He went fishing and caught a fish with a fishing rod.

259
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:08,960
Fishing, there are fishing rods, rods that older people often have

260
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:17,640
We need canes. One cane, one cane, one cane, sugar canes. And now,

261
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:24,260
Who's that in that old, beat-up car? Is that Uncle Guillaume?

262
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Yes, that's Uncle Guillaume in that old clunker. A new car, an old clunker, a

263
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,800
Vieux taco.

264
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,020
A nice car, an old clunker.

265
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,840
Uncle Guillaume no longer has his 604.

266
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,000
He was forced to sell it.

267
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
Because he is ruined.

268
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,520
Yes, I am ruined, my poor little Mireille.

269
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,440
This is a ruined castle.

270
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,500
And there you have it, a ruined man.

271
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,040
Uncle Guillaume is ruined.

272
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,800
Because he played roulette at the Monte Carlo casino.

273
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,620
And he lost.

274
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,040
He lost his entire fortune.

275
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,140
I lost everything at roulette in the Monte Carlo casino.

276
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm leaving for Kathmandu.

277
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,800
Yes, it seems you can live there for next to nothing.

278
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,360
Three times nothing.

279
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,180
In Portugal, port wine is not expensive.

280
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,240
He's not responsible.

281
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,220
It seems he had nothing to do with it there.

282
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,960
And life in Kathmandu is even cheaper.

283
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,700
It's nothing much.

284
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,380
Yes, it seems you can live there for next to nothing.

285
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:35,160
At that moment, Robert notices a young man with beautiful muscular legs whom he has seen somewhere before.

286
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,380
What did he do with his Alpine 310?

287
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,440
Yes, but he's never owned an Alpine. He's broke. He doesn't have a penny to his name.

288
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:52,440
It is cut like the wheat. Wheat. A field of wheat. A harvested wheat field.

289
00:17:52,440 --> 00:18:00,840
They are going to mow, they are mowing, they are mowing, they are mowing with a scythe.

290
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,480
Here, the wheat has been harvested.

291
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,860
And Jean-Claude is broke, broke as a pancake.

292
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,380
Without his forehead. It's cheap, it's for nothing.

293
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,580
Yeah, but I'm broke. I'm scared.

294
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,480
He's broke too, he doesn't have a penny to his name.

295
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,180
And now, Aunt Georgette is driving by in a beautiful little convertible.

296
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
She doesn't look like she's broke.

297
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,440
Mireille can't believe what she sees.

298
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,180
She thinks she's dreaming.

299
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,680
Hey, pinch me. Tell me I'm dreaming.

300
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,180
Pinch me.

301
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,220
Here, it was a crab that pinched Mireille.

302
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,600
A lobster claw.

303
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,060
Pliers.

304
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,460
A clothespin.

305
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Come on, give me back my gumballs, or I'll pinch you

306
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,560
Ouch, that one little girl pinched me!

307
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,100
Mireille thinks she's dreaming; she has the impression she's dreaming.

308
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,800
She wants us to pinch her to wake her up

309
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,220
Hey, please pass me the phone, tell me I'm dreaming

310
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,260
Marie-Laure often dreams

311
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,100
Marie-Laure, you're dreaming

312
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,180
No, you're dreaming, that's not right, no, why would I give them to you?

313
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:25,380
But Mireille isn't dreaming, no, no, no, no, no, it really is Aunt Georgette in that magnificent convertible.

314
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,220
Convertible, remember?

315
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,700
Aunt Georgette is wearing a very beautiful, very chic scarf

316
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,380
He too is wearing a scarf

317
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,900
She too is wearing a scarf

318
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
She too is wearing a scarf

319
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,420
There you go, a scarf

320
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:47,880
And next to Aunt Georgette, there is a handsome, dark-haired man, a very handsome man, very dark-haired.

321
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,400
A handsome, dark-haired man, yes, a handsome, dark-haired man.

322
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,080
Aunt Georgette's handsome, dark-haired man is very tanned.

323
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
Uncle Guillaume is also always very tanned.

324
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,800
Mireille is sunbathing here.

325
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
The mountains are great for getting a tan.

326
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,760
You can get a tan at the beach too.

327
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:15,020
Georges de Pignerole is tanned and he is wearing a silk shirt, silk

328
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,700
He also wears a goatee.

329
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,720
A neck, a collar, a necklace, a beard

330
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,960
A necklace, a necklace, a beard necklace, a beard necklace

331
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,220
Uncle Guillaume is ruined

332
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,120
But Aunt Georgette is rich. She won the jackpot in the National Lottery.

333
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,880
Did I win the lottery jackpot?

334
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,500
They too have won the jackpot.

335
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,480
The 307! The 307!

336
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,140
Come see! Come see! Come! Look!

337
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,920
Oh shit !

338
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,620
We won! We won!

339
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,360
We won! We won!

340
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,940
Aunt Georgette won the jackpot with a ticket that Fido found on the ground.

341
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,500
That's luck.

342
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,960
So, Aunt Georgette goes to get engaged at the Taj Mahal.

343
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,880
And then, she's going to Isfahan to breathe in the roses.

344
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,080
Breathe.

345
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,220
Stop breathing.

346
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,960
Breathe.

347
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,780
Stop breathing.

348
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,980
Aunt Georgette will breathe in the scent of roses

349
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,460
The scent of roses is intoxicating.

350
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,720
Like alcohol, like wine

351
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,860
The sea air is intoxicating too.

352
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,580
Even in the mountains, the air is intoxicating.

353
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,120
She will get engaged at the Taj Mahal

354
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,560
At his age? That's insane.

355
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,560
He's delirious, he doesn't know what he's saying.

356
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,560
She's going to get engaged at the Taj Mahal.

357
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,560
At his age? That's insane.

358
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,560
That's insane. That's insane too.

359
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
But they're completely crazy, those women.

360
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
That's crazy too.

361
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:30,880
That too is crazy, that's not normal.

362
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,820
Finally, the cider arrives.

363
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,380
Take it easy.

364
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,600
Gently, gently.

365
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,580
Damn drawer!

366
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,440
Hey, take it easy, you're going to break everything.

367
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,900
Take my gumballs!

368
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,280
Hey, easy now, easy now!

369
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,500
Robert is the one who opens the bottle.

370
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,380
a cork

371
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,240
boucher

372
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,300
unblock

373
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,840
uncork a bottle of Bordeaux

374
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,180
it's not difficult

375
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,860
but uncorking a bottle of sparkling wine

376
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,320
That's another story.

377
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,860
because the Sparkling Wine

378
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,020
it foams

379
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,880
Here's some foam

380
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,400
foam

381
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Sparkling wine

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,200
and the cork pops out

383
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,800
The cork pops out, creating a spray of cider.

384
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,440
Here is a sheaf of wheat, a sheaf, sheaves

385
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,880
A spray of cider soaks Mireille's skirt and Robert's jacket

386
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,980
And the cork comes and hits the boy

387
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,620
Thugs attacked this old lady

388
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,800
They hit me to make me tell them where my savings were.

389
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,560
He strikes his instrument

390
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,980
He hits him right in the face

391
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,500
The cork hits the boy right in the face.

392
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,480
And then he continues on his trajectory

393
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,900
The trajectory of an arrow

394
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
The trajectory of a ball

395
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,540
The trajectory of a cannonball

396
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,700
The cork hits the boy and the man in black squarely in the forehead

397
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:25,400
This man is hit right in the forehead, the forehead, the forehead. The man in black runs away, he runs away.

398
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:39,420
He ran away, and Fido, Fido ran away, the man in black ran away, knocking something over.

399
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:47,700
He knocks over the chair, he knocks over a flowerpot, there's a boat capsizing, the man in black

400
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:56,460
She left a notebook on the table; she tore a sheet of paper from her notebook—a ticket book.

401
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:04,980
a book of metro tickets, an address book, the notebook of the man in black, there are several

402
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:12,000
Photos slipping away. There are papers slipping away. They're slipping away. She, she can't

403
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,920
Not to escape. But this one manages to escape. Photos escape from the notebook. The photos

404
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:27,460
escape from the bag. The pages of this notebook are blackened with notes. There are many notes.

405
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,580
The pages are black with notes.

406
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,160
The miners have faces blackened with coal.

407
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,520
These are walls blackened with smoke.

408
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,380
Jean-Claude's eyes are blackened with mascara.

409
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,840
Okay, let's see what you've learned.

410
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,780
Look, listen, think, and speak.

411
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,880
What are Mireille and Robert doing here?

412
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,460
Are they doing a detox or are they just having a pot of something?

413
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,780
They have a drink

414
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,640
Look at this young man

415
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,320
Where does he get kicked?

416
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,860
Right in the forehead or in the buttocks?

417
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,640
In the rear

418
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,440
And what is it?

419
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,860
A bottle of cider or a pot of yogurt?

420
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,000
A pot of yogurt

421
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,280
Do you have friends who are going to Portugal?

422
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,780
You want them to bring you back a bottle of Port

423
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,400
What are you saying?

424
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,240
Bring me back a bottle of Port

425
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,740
I will reimburse you

426
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,440
Look at Jean-Claude here

427
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,520
Is he rolling in money or is he broke?

428
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,300
He's broke.

429
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,700
What do we say when we see something incredible?

430
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,480
Hey, put me through! Tell me I'm dreaming!

431
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Does this gentleman have a scarf or a beard?

432
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,680
A beard necklace.

433
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,900
And what does the cork do?

434
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,040
He jumps.

435
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,440
And what is the man in black doing?

436
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,140
He ran away.

437
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,340
But who is this man in black?

438
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,360
Mystery and a ball of gane.

439
