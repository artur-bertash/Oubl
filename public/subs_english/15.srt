Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,460
Watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,020
Pretty soon you will figure out what's going on.

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,300
And be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,260
Marie-Laure has sent her sister on a wild goose chase.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,900
When Mireille returns, Robert tries to persuade her to join him in calling on Madame Courtois.

7
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,580
It's just his luck that Mireille has already planned a trip to Chartres.

8
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,320
Ever resourceful, Robert has a brainstorm.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,020
Could he join her?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,600
The Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, on a beautiful spring day.

11
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,880
There are flowers, little birds, the weather is beautiful.

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,380
There isn't a cloud in the sky. Ah, ah, yes, yes, there are a few clouds.

13
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,460
A young man, dark-haired, quite tall, and friendly.

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, he's quite nice, isn't he?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,100
is sitting on a bridge.

16
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,960
He is talking to a little girl

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,940
who owns a boat.

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,640
This young man is not French.

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,280
He has been in France for two days.

20
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,460
In the distance, a young girl arrives.

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,700
Hey, look who's back, my sister.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,180
Well, I'm leaving now.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,700
I'm going to enjoy the wind while it lasts.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,540
My sister doesn't seem happy

25
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,760
When I told her that Mom was looking for her earlier

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,540
That wasn't true

27
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,140
It was a joke

28
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,480
You don't tell him anything

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,460
Mystery and bubblegum

30
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,120
THANKS

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,200
Bye

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,740
Bye.

33
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,620
Where is Marie-Laure?

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,480
She just left that way in her boat.

35
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,180
She told me she was going to enjoy the wind while it lasted.

36
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,840
What a nasty little girl.

37
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,520
She said my mother was looking for me, but there was no one at home.

38
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,660
Another one of his stupid jokes.

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,900
She's impossible, that girl.

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,820
Is it that...

41
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,480
Are you familiar with the Basque Country?

42
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,100
So, you, we can say, have some rather unexpected questions.

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,600
Why are you asking me that?

44
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,880
I really don't see the connection.

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,440
Yes, I know him a little.

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,400
Last summer, we went to Saint-Jean-de-Luz.

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Back when I was little, we used to go to Belle-Île-en-Mer, in Brittany.

48
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,220
I liked Belle-Île, it was peaceful.

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,460
There were fewer people.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,840
We went sailing, we fished for shrimp, we caught crabs.

51
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,560
And when it rained, we played portrait.

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,760
We used to go see old movies.

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,880
But my sister thought it wasn't trendy enough.

54
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,980
I mean fashionable.

55
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,220
So last year, we went to Saint-Jean.

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,820
It's more lively.

57
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,480
But why are you asking me that?

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,440
I want to go.

59
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,180
My mother often talked to me about it when I was a child.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,160
It's a very beautiful country. And is your mother from there?

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,520
No, not really.

62
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,640
But she spent several years there as a child.

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,820
My grandfather, my mother's father, was a judge.

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,260
His first post was in La Rochelle.

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,820
My mother was born while my grandparents were in La Rochelle.

66
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,280
Then my grandfather went to court in Bayonne, when my mother was 4 or 5 years old.

67
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,100
They stayed in Bayonne for 6 or 7 years, I think.

68
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,080
It was while they were in Bayonne that my mother met this Madame Courtois.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
Indeed, she was born in the Basque Country.

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,280
And his parents were shopkeepers.

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,840
They had a small fabric shop opposite the cathedral.

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,380
And your grandparents, where are they now?

73
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,120
They are both dead.

74
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,980
They died when I was 9 or 10 years old.

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,200
But tell me, I was thinking, I'm going to the Courtois' place tomorrow.

76
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,620
You wouldn't happen to want to go see them tomorrow, would you?

77
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,040
Since Mrs. Courtois is your godmother.

78
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,500
No, I can't tomorrow. I have to go to Chartres.

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,140
See the cathedral? I want to go see it too, one day.

80
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,140
No, I know the cathedral.

81
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,780
I visited it at least 5 or 6 times with my parents

82
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,120
And just as many times with school

83
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,520
Tomorrow I have to go see an exhibition

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,800
In a small museum located right next door

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,820
Would you please allow me to...

86
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,400
To accompany me?

87
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,560
Oh, but you can if you want.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,020
But you forget that tomorrow you're going to the Courtois' house

89
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,080
I can go another day

90
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,640
The day after tomorrow, for example

91
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,680
Mireille !

92
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:23,640
Mireille! What? What's wrong now? I've broken down. You've broken down? Yes, my boat has broken down.

93
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,160
There's no more wind, he's in the middle of the pool. He's not coming back. Come on! Listen, you're bothering me.

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:39,540
Figure it out yourself. Come on! No! Come on! I'm going. But how annoying is that kid?

95
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Hey, are you kidding us?

96
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,420
No, no, no, my boat is broken down, it's in the middle of the basin, oh!

97
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,520
Yes, he was there a little while ago, in the middle of the pool.

98
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
The wind has returned, that's all.

99
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,940
Oh, it's all a melee now.

100
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,140
Hey, figure it out yourself.

101
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,440
It's not a problem. I'll fix it.

102
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,760
And there you have it.

103
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, say thank you.

104
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,920
THANKS.

105
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,780
You are too kind.

106
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,420
But tell me, with all that said, what is your name?

107
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,320
Robert Taylor.

108
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,280
No relation to the actor.

109
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,380
And you?

110
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,800
Mireille Bello. No relation to the poet.

111
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,380
What a pedant, that Mireille!

112
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,000
She is referring to Rémi Bello, a somewhat forgotten 16th-century poet.

113
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,720
We are in Luxembourg.

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
There are flowers.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,560
One flower, several flowers.

116
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,140
There are birds.

117
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
One bird, several birds.

118
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,000
The weather is nice.

119
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,480
It's a beautiful spring day.

120
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,800
It's a beautiful spring day.

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,880
One morning, one morning.

122
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,100
One day, one day.

123
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,300
One evening, one night.

124
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,340
One year, one year.

125
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,440
Marie-Laure is talking to Robert.

126
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,200
She owns a boat.

127
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,980
Here, she is holding a biscuit in her right hand.

128
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,080
Here, she is holding a candy.

129
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,700
Here, she is holding Fido in her arms.

130
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:48,920
To have.

131
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,360
We hold, you hold, they hold, you hold, I hold.

132
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,900
It's like the verb "to come".

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,120
We come, you come, they come, you (feminine) come, you (plural) come, I come.

134
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,300
Or come back.

135
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,100
We're coming back, you're coming back, they're coming back,

136
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,420
She comes back, you come back, I come back.

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,900
Hey, here comes my sister again.

138
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,760
Well, I'm leaving now.

139
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,320
I'm going to enjoy the wind while it lasts.

140
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,820
It's windy.

141
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,520
It is the wind that makes the windmills turn.

142
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,540
It is the wind that makes sailboats move.

143
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,320
When there is wind, the boats sail.

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,420
When there is no wind, sailboats are at a standstill.

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,260
They are not walking, they are not moving forward.

146
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,520
It's windy.

147
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,860
Marie-Laure wants to take advantage of the wind to play with her boat.

148
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,720
There isn't always wind.

149
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,480
You have to take advantage of the wind when there is any.

150
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,760
The weather isn't always nice.

151
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,600
We should take advantage of the good weather to go to Luxembourg.

152
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,860
But when the weather is bad,

153
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,660
We should take advantage of bad weather to work.

154
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,620
to do homework.

155
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,800
That's Mireille's opinion, but not Marie-Laure's.

156
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,740
Listen.

157
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,140
It's raining. You should take advantage of it to do your holiday homework.

158
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,580
No, I'm going to take advantage of this time to have a nap.

159
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,180
It's definitely calmer when the children are at high school.

160
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,280
Yes, when they're not here, I take the opportunity to get some work done.

161
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,660
The man is taking advantage of his children's absence to work.

162
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,120
But Marie-Laure doesn't want to go to work.

163
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,360
She doesn't want to go to work.

164
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,320
She doesn't feel like working; she'd rather take a nap or go play with her boat.

165
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,980
Look at Jean-Claude, he wants something.

166
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,620
What are you having for dinner tonight?

167
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,040
Do you want to have dinner with Irina and me?

168
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,780
Mireille is not happy.

169
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,380
My sister doesn't look happy.

170
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,220
Mireille is not happy.

171
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,540
Look at Marie-Laure here.

172
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,860
She is happy.

173
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,460
Owl !

174
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,200
He is not happy.

175
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,900
She is not happy

176
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,760
Now observe this couple

177
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:18,860
Mireille is not happy because Marie-Laure played a joke on her

178
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,940
She told him that Madame Bello had been looking for her.

179
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
So Mireille went home

180
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,400
But that wasn't true, Madame Bello wasn't there

181
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,200
It was a joke.

182
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,080
When I told her that Mom was looking for her earlier, it wasn't true.

183
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
It was a joke.

184
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,880
Marie-Laure likes to tell jokes.

185
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,400
Here, look.

186
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,700
Look, I caught a snake.

187
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,260
Oh!

188
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,720
Oh my God, you're crazy.

189
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,240
Drop it right now.

190
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,100
Oh, but don't be scared, it's a joke.

191
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,020
Look, it's a fake snake.

192
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,440
It's not a real snake, it's a fake snake.

193
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,220
Give it to me, look, that's a real snake.

194
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,160
But no, that's not a real snake, it's a fake snake.

195
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,420
Now, this is going to be a game.

196
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,420
If I say that Mireille is a brunette, is that true or false?

197
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,960
That's wrong.

198
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,420
If I say that Marie-Laure has a boat, is that true or false?

199
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,880
It's true.

200
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,420
If I say that there are flowers in Luxembourg, is that true or false?

201
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,660
It's true.

202
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,020
If I say there isn't a cloud, is that true or false?

203
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,580
That's wrong.

204
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,360
And when Marie-Laure told Mireille that her mother had been looking for her, it was a lie.

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,300
And that's why Mireille is not happy and says that Marie-Laure is a nasty kid, a nasty little girl.

206
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,960
What a nasty little girl! She told me my mother was looking for me when there was nobody at home.

207
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,700
This is just another one of his stupid jokes.

208
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,200
That girl is absolutely impossible.

209
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,320
Robert smiled because he knew it was a joke.

210
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,680
He changes the course of the conversation.

211
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,420
He asks an unexpected question.

212
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,280
Are you familiar with the Basque Country?

213
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,940
Mireille doesn't see the connection between Marie-Laure's joke and the Basque Country.

214
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,340
Well, you guys, it's safe to say you have some rather unexpected questions.

215
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,880
Why are you asking me that? I really don't see the connection.

216
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:31,700
Similarly, when Marie-Laure says she got a ten in French at school because she doesn't want to go to bed, her mother says she doesn't see the connection.

217
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,740
Go to bed, my little one.

218
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,820
Oh, Mom, I got a ten on my Franceuf homework.

219
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,140
That's very good, but I don't see the connection.

220
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,340
There is no connection.

221
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,880
Are you familiar with the Basque Country?

222
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,840
Mireille is surprised.

223
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,200
That's a strange question.

224
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:59,020
The Basque Country has nothing to do with Marie-Laure's jokes; that's an unexpected question.

225
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,380
Look here, what are you doing here? You're not at school, Mireille is surprised because she

226
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:11,620
Marie-Laure wasn't expecting it. Marie-Laure's arrival was unexpected; what an unexpected visit!

227
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:18,680
The lady is surprised because she wasn't expecting this visit; that too is unexpected.

228
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:27,320
In an unexpected turn of events, Robert asks Mireille if she knows the Basque Country.

229
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,060
You know the Basque Country, you know Australian cuisine, you have

230
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:40,040
I tried it, it's good, Australian food, you know it, right? But look at Sonia, who is she?

231
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:53,000
Is it Antoine? She knows him. Sonia and Antoine know each other. Sonia, my friend, good evening. I know.

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Very well, who is it? We've already got him started, haven't we? And you know the country.

233
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:11,420
Basque, you know where it is, you know the Basque Country, you know

234
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:18,260
You don't know where it is, it's in the southwest of France, it's partly in France

235
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:25,640
and partly in Spain, it's a very beautiful country, there are mountains and the sea, Basque houses

236
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Basque, frontons for playing Basque pelota, there are beaches, Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz.

237
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,320
In the summer, it's very crowded, with lots of tourists, it's very lively.

238
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,880
Mireille finds it more lively than Brittany.

239
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,160
In Brittany, there are fewer people, it's more peaceful.

240
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,540
Saint-Jean-de-Luz is more lively.

241
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,140
Here is a lively street, a quiet street.

242
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,420
But Cécile felt that Brittany was too quiet, not lively enough.

243
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,040
Not fashionable enough, not trendy enough.

244
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,920
These Breton women are not fashionable, they are not trendy.

245
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,540
These young women are more in tune with the times.

246
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,520
These young men are trendy, but this young woman is not.

247
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,940
This one is in vogue.

248
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,540
Mind, hein, mec, là!

249
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,680
These ladies are not in vogue.

250
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
These people are not trendy.

251
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,860
In Brittany, it was a peaceful holiday.

252
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,680
We fished for shrimp, we fished for crabs.

253
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,300
Robert wants to go to the Basque Country because his mother often talked about it.

254
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,880
His mother's father, his grandfather, was a magistrate.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
He was a judge in a court.

256
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,540
First, he was a judge at the court in La Rochelle.

257
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,140
on the Atlantic

258
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,880
then he became a judge

259
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,320
at the Bayonne court

260
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,960
the parents of

261
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,760
Madame Courtois were shopkeepers

262
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,160
In Bayonne, they had a fabric shop

263
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,360
they were selling Basque linen

264
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,940
Madame Courtois

265
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,760
and Robert's mother

266
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,420
met in Bayonne

267
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,800
when they were children

268
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,720
when they were children

269
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,880
it's the verb to be

270
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,540
I was

271
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,600
You were, he was, they were, we were, you were.

272
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,120
Robert plans to visit the Courtois the next day.

273
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,540
He suggests that Mireille go and see them too.

274
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,820
since Mrs. Courtois is her godmother.

275
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,840
She can go see her if she wants.

276
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm going to the Courtois' place tomorrow.

277
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,940
You don't happen to want to go see them tomorrow, do you?

278
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,200
since Mrs. Courtois is your godmother.

279
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,220
But Mireille cannot, because she has to go to Chartres.

280
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,220
No, I can't tomorrow, I have to go to Chartres.

281
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,860
Robert also wants to go to Chartres, to see the cathedral.

282
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,320
But Mireille is not going to see the cathedral, she is going to the museum.

283
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,640
A small museum located next to the cathedral.

284
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,700
A museum, you know what that is.

285
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,480
Like the Louvre Museum, the Petit Palais Museum,

286
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,400
like the Mecca Gallery in the South of France, for example.

287
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
She is going to see an exhibition of paintings.

288
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,280
In Chartres, there is a cathedral and a museum.

289
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,080
Let's ask some French people if they know Chartres.

290
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,880
Are you familiar with Chartres?

291
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,380
Not very good, but I know its cathedral well, like everyone else.

292
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,780
What is interesting about Chartres?

293
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,660
Beautiful cathedral.

294
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,920
There is the cathedral, which is very well known.

295
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,920
Robert asks Mireille if he can go to Chartres with her.

296
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Would you please allow me to...

297
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,820
Mireille replies that Robert can accompany her if he wants.

298
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,680
But you can if you want to.

299
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,580
Power and will.

300
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,920
We can if we want to.

301
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,900
You can if you want.

302
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,500
They can if they want to.

303
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,220
She can if she wants to.

304
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,300
You can if you want.

305
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,060
I can if I want to.

306
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,040
Where there's a will, there's a way.

307
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,920
Yeah, that's what people say, but it's not always true.

308
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,040
You can't, you can't, you can't, you don't want to.

309
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,060
Would you please allow me to...

310
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,380
To accompany me? But you can if you want.

311
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,720
But you don't have to go see the Courtois tomorrow?

312
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I can go another day, the day after tomorrow for example.

313
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,060
If today is Wednesday, tomorrow will be Thursday.

314
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,820
And the day after tomorrow, it will be Friday.

315
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,200
Look at Marie-Laure.

316
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,920
Mireille !

317
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
She has a problem.

318
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,840
His boat is broken down in the middle of the basin.

319
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,280
But Mireille doesn't want to help him.

320
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,120
She doesn't want to deal with it.

321
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,940
Oh, listen, you're bothering me. Figure it out yourself.

322
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,380
Look at this string.

323
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,620
It's all tangled up, all confused.

324
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,340
There's a problem.

325
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,480
Now she's cleared up.

326
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,840
Look at this man.

327
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,540
He's all confused.

328
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,020
He had a problem. Now he's sorted it out. He doesn't have a problem anymore.

329
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,600
SO ?

330
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,860
So, I don't know exactly what you all signed.

331
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,380
Fine. Figure it out yourself. What do you want me to say?

332
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,560
But Marie-Laure cannot manage on her own.

333
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,980
Help me, I can't get down.

334
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,340
You managed to get up. Well, now you manage to get down.

335
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,180
Now you will speak.

336
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,080
Listen to this dialogue between Mireille and Marie-Laure.

337
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,660
You are Mireille and you are going to answer Marie-Laure.

338
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,360
Mireille! What? What is it now?

339
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm broken down. Are you broken down?

340
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,880
Yes, my boat isn't moving anymore. There's no wind, it's in the middle of the basin, it won't come back. Come on!

341
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,440
Okay, listen, you're bothering me, sort it out yourself!

342
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,980
Now it's your turn. You are Mireille.

343
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,400
Mireille! What? What is it now?

344
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,100
What? What else is there?

345
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,900
What? What else is there?

346
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,080
I'm broken down. You're broken down.

347
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,320
You're broken down.

348
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,260
You're broken down.

349
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,820
Yes, the boat is broken down.

350
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,940
Listen, you're bothering me, sort it out yourself.

351
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,440
Listen, you're bothering me, sort it out yourself.

352
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,840
Listen, you're bothering me, sort it out yourself.

353
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,700
Mireille doesn't want to go to the pool to help Marie-Laure.

354
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,440
But Robert is going.

355
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,480
I'm going.

356
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
Robert goes to the pool.

357
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,640
Robert and he goes.

358
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,300
He plans to go to the Courtois' house the next day.

359
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,100
But he can go another day.

360
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,340
"I can go another day."

361
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,620
"I can go to the Courtois' place another day."

362
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,820
"I can go another day."

363
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,300
She has to go to Chartres.

364
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,540
He wants to go too.

365
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,060
He wants to go to the Basque Country.

366
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,180
He wants to go.

367
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,160
Marie-Laure told Mireille that her boat had broken down in the middle of the basin.

368
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,680
"Yes, my boat isn't moving anymore."

369
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,440
There is no more wind, he is in the middle of the basin, he is not coming back.

370
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:14,240
But when Robert and Mireille arrive at the dock, the boat is not broken down in the middle of the dock at all.

371
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,540
He is on the edge.

372
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,900
So Mireille thinks that Marie-Laure has played another joke on her.

373
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,220
She believes that Marie-Laure is making fun of her.

374
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,760
Are you kidding us?

375
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,220
No, Marie-Laure is not making fun of Robert and Mireille.

376
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,840
This is not a joke.

377
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,960
Now the boat is at the edge of the basin.

378
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,500
But just five minutes ago, he was in the middle of the pool.

379
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,420
Ah yes, earlier, he was there, in the middle of the pool.

380
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,780
Now the boat's lines are all tangled up, all tangled up.

381
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,520
Oh, it's all tangled up.

382
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,580
Mireille doesn't want to help him.

383
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,860
Figure it out yourself.

384
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,800
But Robert will help him. He's a kind man, that Robert.

385
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,760
It's not a problem. I'll fix it.

386
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,120
And he ties up the wires.

387
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,540
And there you go, it's sorted.

388
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,200
Now, Mireille is going to ask Robert what his name is.

389
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,620
She has known Robert for two days and she doesn't know his name.

390
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,360
You're too kind. But tell me, with all that said, what's your name?

391
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,080
That's the verb "s'appeler".

392
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,440
My name is Mireille, Mireille Bello. And you, what is your name?

393
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,900
Notice, this child doesn't want to say what his dad's name is.

394
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,940
And your dad, what's his name? You don't want to tell me?

395
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,500
And what's your name?

396
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,860
You do know your name, though.

397
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,400
In addition, he is mute.

398
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:50,640
My name is, your name is, her name is, his name is, our names are, you (plural) are, she will be called.

399
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,340
Call, call, call, let's call, call, call.

400
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,140
It's the same with the verb "amener".

401
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,560
"I apologize for yesterday, but I had to take my little sister to her dance class."

402
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,020
She's bringing him, she had to bring him.

403
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,480
Bring, bring.

404
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,720
The girl's name is Mireille.

405
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,380
The young man will be called Robert.

406
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,080
Robert Taylor. No relation to the actor.

407
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,920
Robert Taylor is an actor. A movie actor.

408
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,380
A French actor?

409
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,420
No, American.

410
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,820
Is it or was it?

411
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,220
Is he still alive? Is he still alive?

412
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,120
Or is he dead?

413
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,400
In any case, he was a very well-known actor, a bit forgotten now, but around 1950 he was very famous.

414
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,980
Robert's name is Taylor, like the actor, but there is no connection.

415
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,420
It's a coincidence, a chance occurrence.

416
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,980
And Mireille's name is...

417
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,240
Mireille Bello. No relation to the poet.

418
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,800
Rémi Bello was a poet.

419
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,920
He wrote poems.

420
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,180
He was born in 1528.

421
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,000
And he died in 1577. He was a 16th-century poet.

422
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,400
Victor Hugo was also a poet. He was born in 1802 and died in 1885.

423
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,860
He is a 19th-century poet.

424
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,960
Rainer Maria Rilke is also a poet. He is a German poet.

425
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:23,540
He was born in 1875. He died in 1926. He was a 20th-century poet.

426
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:37,340
Garcia Lorca was also a poet, a Spanish poet. He was born in 1899 and died in 1936. He was a 20th-century poet.

427
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,200
Okay, let's see what you know. Let's see if you can distinguish between true and false.

428
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:57,440
Those are flowers. True, that's true. They are flowers. It's a beautiful spring day. False.

429
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,440
Marie-Laure is working, she's doing her homework. Wrong. She's holding her boat under her arm.

430
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:13,080
Marie-Laure goes to school on Wednesdays. No way! That's wrong. She doesn't go to school on Wednesdays.

431
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,600
There is no wind. The boat has broken down. False.

432
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:26,020
Robert's mother's father, that is to say his maternal grandfather, was a merchant in Bayonne.

433
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,960
That's false. He was a judge.

434
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,180
Oh, but don't be scared. It's a joke. Look, it's a fake snake.

435
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,340
Marie-Laure is holding a fake snake. That's true.

436
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,180
She is holding a fake snake.

437
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,280
Victor Hugo was a 19th-century French poet.

438
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:48,960
TRUE.

439
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,940
Rémi Bello is a very well-known 20th-century poet.

440
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,140
Faux.

441
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,540
What a pedant this professor is.

442
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,760
A 16th-century poet.

443
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,160
Do you know this Rémi Bello?

444
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,920
I don't know who that is.

445
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,380
He's definitely not very trendy, that one.

446
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,800
Ah, a 16th-century poet.

447
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,180
I don't see the connection.

448
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,840
Oh yes yes yes.

449
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,280
This professor is tiring me out.

450
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,660
What a pedant.

451
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,880
I'm leaving.

452
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,380
I'm going to take a nap.

453
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,880
You don't tell him anything, right?

454
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,700
Okay, I'm going.

455
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,400
What? What else is there?

456
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,960
Ah, my stick.

457
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,160
I forgot my stick.

458
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,020
It might still be useful.

459
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,340
You never know.

460
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:38,380
