00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,620
This was the challenge undertaken by Pierre Capretz and his learning team.

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,440
as well as the television producers of WGBH Boston.

4
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,760
The result of their efforts is this 52-series program

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,440
called “French in Action”,

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,540
a multimedia course that opens a new era in learning.

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,340
The main principle of the course is immersion.

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,820
un process by which students are thrown into a French-speaking world from the very start.

9
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,980
It was frightening at first, but I think after a few lessons,

10
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,360
when you understood the way things were going to be handled,

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,840
you got used to it. It became a little less intimidating.

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,480
We talked with Beatrice Abetti, coordinator of the French in Action project.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,800
The difference between immersion technique and, if you want, a more traditional technique

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:36,380
It's that, instead of giving French word by word, if you will, bit by bit, or, you know, feeding the students, in a certain way, we plunge them, we will put them in a fishing pole of French.

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,800
I think the most valuable part of the course is that you learn all of French at once.

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,420
On the first day of class, the teacher came in speaking French, and on day 1, we spoke French.

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,920
And as for the conversation, we got ourselves out of a situation by speaking French from the beginning.

18
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,480
And it was a faster way to learn a language I had known before.

19
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,500
In this course, we learned everything at the same time, which works really well.

20
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,840
I have studied other languages ​​in the past, and I learned the alphabet in two weeks.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,680
And how to say table and chair, and then body parts,

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,660
And you can't say nothing.

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,980
And with the French class I took here,

24
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,260
It was more about what was happening in real life.

25
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,040
Ah, there you are, perfect timing. Come and help me.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,480
Come on.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,220
French in Action shows what is happening in French life

28
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,740
by presenting cultural documents,

29
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,580
like interviews with people on the street.

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,440
What is your name?

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,500
My name is France.

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
And you, what is your name?

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Jacqueline, my name is Jacqueline.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
And I'm Nicole.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
May I ask how old you are?

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Guess.

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
What is your first name?

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Olivier.

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
And how old are you?

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
12 years old.

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Do you go to school?

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Yes, unfortunately.

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Which school are you going to?

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
At the Buffon high school.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,600
What's your name? My name is Hervé. Hervé what? Hervé Meunier. How old are you? I'm 20 years old.

46
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:29,980
What is your name, madam? Madame Jolyne. Do you live in Paris? JOULIN. Jolyne.

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Do you live in Paris? Of course, it's the fifth arrondissement. It's Paris since I live there.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,240
How long have you been in Paris?

49
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,640
Oh, it's been 35 years, sir. But I'm an old Parisian, you know.

50
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,260
35 years old. I was born near Saint-Gervais.

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,960
Have you always lived in Paris?

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,480
I have always lived in Paris.

53
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,340
These interviews are used to illustrate specific words, such as "tired".

54
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,600
Here, the elderly woman says she is 85 years old and tired.

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,900
I am 85 years old, so I am tired.

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,340
I don't feel well, I'm sick.

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,620
I am sick too.

We always go to the bistro at the station, the women who have taste, the men who have a room.

60
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,840
In this food ad, the central characters help viewers understand the expression "no rush".

Obviously, these horses are not in any particular moment.

63
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Humour, like the French language, is hardly translated and can only be understood from within the French cultural system.

64
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,840
That's the goal of French In Action.

65
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
To achieve this goal, French In Action systematically avoids translation.

66
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Hello, Miss Mireille, how are you?

67
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Okay. Goodbye.

68
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Goodbye, miss.

69
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,840
You see? She speaks French.

70
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,240
No English is ever spoken.

71
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,440
Only the everyday language of the French people.

72
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,640
Good morning.

73
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,540
Good morning.

74
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,000
Where are you going?

75
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,260
When you walk into the first class and you view the first video,

76
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,600
it's very intimidating and frustrating because you have no English to use.

77
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,040
Students do get angry and frustrated, especially at the beginning.

78
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,100
So it was kind of like a challenge to conquer.

79
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,700
They might be uncomfortable for a few weeks.

80
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,900
because there are so many French people who are put on them

81
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,580
and that they only understand the register of that.

82
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,600
But that's good, that's what we want.

83
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,740
I like the fact that there's a French barrier

84
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,060
who is loved by the student.

85
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,740
I like a course that is challenging.

86
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,260
It was funny, because when they spoke French right away,

87
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,240
We felt that we were really going to learn something.

88
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,340
We knew we were going to be immersed in it right away.

89
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,880
And we knew it would be difficult.

90
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,760
But that would be an amazing experience.

91
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,200
We talked with Pierre Capretz about the absence of English and about how you make sense of what you hear.

92
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,560
In this course, we throw lots of French at the students, and only French.

93
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,080
We don't use English. We don't translate. Why?

94
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,860
Well, because French is not a translation of English.

95
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,660
It is not English that has been coded into French.

96
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,760
No, French is French. It is not a code of English.

97
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,580
So that you cannot just replace a French word with an English word

98
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,940
It does not really work

99
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,600
When French people say something in French

100
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,920
It is not that they really mean something in English

101
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,700
But say it in French because they don't know better

102
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,480
Or to show off or out of perversity

103
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,300
No, when they say something in French

104
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,080
They mean something French

105
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,240
So, to understand what a French word means

106
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,100
What you need to do is observe the circumstances in which it is used.

107
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,400
That's what will tell you what that saying means.

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,980
Think of saying hello, for example.

109
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,620
What does that mean?

110
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,520
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

111
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,380
Well, not exactly.

112
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,100
But look at yourself.

113
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,340
Good morning.

114
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,380
Hello, Mrs. Nutigl.

115
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,140
Hello Sir.

116
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,020
Good morning.

117
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,000
Hello, Miss Bello.

118
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,020
Hello Sir.

119
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,460
You see that "bonjour" is something that French people say when they meet someone.

120
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,500
It's the meaning of "hello", the circumstances in which it is used.

121
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,940
Note that there are words that are used in different types of circumstances.

122
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,820
"Hello," for example. Look how it's used here.

123
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,660
You see, "hi" is something you say when you meet someone.

124
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,400
But now, look at this.

125
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,380
You see that "hi" is also something you say when you go out.

126
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:12,100
In this course, we do not translate the words, but we show them used in a number of situations.

127
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,800
so that students can understand what they mean through observation and deduction.

128
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,960
Here's how it works.

129
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:28,160
You see the teacher on the first day of the French class announcing nous allons apprendre le français.

130
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,380
Then you see a child learning how to read and you hear il apprend à lire.

131
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,260
Then you see a little girl studying her lessons and you hear elle apprend ses leçons.

132
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,060
Then you see her learning how to knit and you hear elle apprend à tricoter.

133
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,140
You see a young woman who's learning how to play the guitar and you hear

134
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,740
She is learning to play the guitar.

135
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,680
You see a man learning how to swim and you hear

136
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,520
He is learning to swim.

137
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,920
By then, you're beginning to suspect that this word, apprendre, apprend,

138
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,820
has something to do with the notion of learning.

139
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
Let's take another example.

140
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,940
You see someone in a hurry and you hear presser.

141
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,640
then you see someone who is not in a hurry and you hear pas pressé you compare

142
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,200
the two and you get a notion that pressé pas pressé has something to do with

143
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,800
being in a hurry or not being in a hurry or else you see a young woman who is

144
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,620
sick in bed and you hear elle est malade you see other people who look sick and

145
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,280
And you hear "sick, sick, sick, sick".

146
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,060
Then you see a young woman who does not look sick at all

147
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,020
and you hear pas malade.

148
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,000
You get an idea that sick, not sick

149
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,920
must have something to do with being sick or not being sick.

150
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,540
We don't have to tell you.

151
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,900
You figured it out by yourself, progressively, in a natural way.

152
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,500
All you have to do is to observe, to listen,

153
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,280
and to put two and two together.

154
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,780
Now, if you don't understand everything the first time around,

155
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,140
it's all right, it's perfectly natural.

156
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,180
It will come progressively.

157
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,840
French in Action présente French through a continuing story.

158
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,880
A light, almost fanciful tale about Albert,

159
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,500
a young American who meets a French woman, Mireille,

160
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,740
her impish sister, Marie-Laure,

161
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,880
her uncle, Guillaume,

162
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,380
her aunt, Georgette.

163
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,440
her friends, Colette,

164
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,500
Hubert, a young man who plays his part

165
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,420
like a nobleman, Jean-Pierre,

166
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,520
a chance encounter

167
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,700
and dozens of other French people

168
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,240
in all aspects of life.

169
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,500
Even if the details of this story

170
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,180
are true, it's not supposed

171
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,940
to be taken into account.

172
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,880
You really see the grammar used in action

173
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,620
as opposed to just learning it in a boring, dry lesson.

174
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,720
We talked with Barry Lydgate

175
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,580
about the role of the story in the course.

176
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,500
The drama on which this whole course is based

177
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,720
is a wonderful feature of the course in two ways.

178
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,340
First of all, it is motivational.

179
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,880
It's the student's way of getting access to the culture,

180
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,080
of understanding the characters,

181
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,720
of finding out about French life and language.

182
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:50,960
The situations were very real, and it was a story of the mind, and it was a good vehicle, I think.

183
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,140
This course gives you access to a very vital, exciting and creative culture.

184
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:02,100
And it's important to see it that way, and it's also important to have fun, to relax, to rest, to enjoy the class.

185
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,420
It is full of wonderful images, wonderful characters, wonderful languages.

186
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:13,860
We'll take care of you.

187
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,140
Hello, I am Marie-Claude.

188
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,360
Hello, I am Marie-Claude.

189
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,400
Hello, I am Marie-Claude.

190
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:46,560
Not well. What's wrong? Are you sick? No, I'm not sick. I'm not feeling well, I'm tired.

191
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,980
The second part of each lesson clarifies and illustrates the dialogue in the story.

192
00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:06,360
She is tired. She too is tired. She is tired. She is tired. He is tired. He is tired.

193
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,680
He is tired.

194
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,140
I'm tired.

195
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,560
Fatigue.

196
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,140
Georgette is tired too.

197
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,260
It's tiring.

198
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,240
She is tired.

199
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,680
Listen.

200
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,640
One of the main functions of the course is that it involves students

201
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,900
to hear the language before they see it written down.

202
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,940
The course introduces spoken language before it introduces written language.

203
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,320
or before she asks students to read and write actively

204
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,660
for a very good reason.

205
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:45,320
French and English are written using the same alphabet, but the ways in which sounds are represented in French are different from the ways in which they are represented in English.

206
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:53,900
And it is important for students to hear the sound before reproducing it from a written representation.

207
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:01,980
If you take, for example, the word "how", which is written HOW,

208
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,620
English writers will instinctively see this.

209
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,320
through the prism of their own writing system

210
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,920
and will say how, when in fact the French word is pronounced how

211
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,680
and means something completely different.

212
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,060
An essential activity for students

213
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,040
is to imitate what they see and hear.

214
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,520
They should watch closely and repeat.

215
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,760
either to themselves, or, better still, in writing.

216
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,180
In all programs, there is a point where students can take on the role of one of the characters.

217
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,660
Here's how it works.

218
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,640
The students see an exchange between two characters, for example between Mireille and Mrs. Rosa.

219
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,260
The exchange is repeated.

220
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,700
Next, Miss Rosa's line is heard twice.

221
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,840
Then, a brake on the brake to give the students a chance to rehearse.

222
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,040
When they come to an interactive segment, students should try, if possible, to repeat it when they have time to do so.

223
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,880
And they should talk, they shouldn't be grumpy about it.

224
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,520
It's very important to say this in a moment,

225
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,760
as if you were talking to someone halfway across the room.

226
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,140
It felt weird to be talking to a slap-puncher.

227
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,060
And I often ask myself, who is listening?

228
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,540
And the only thing that matters is that I'm learning something.

229
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,480
After watching the program,

230
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,440
Students should work with the audio cassettes from French In Action.

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,720
This allows them to practice historical dialogue

232
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,880
by repeating...

233
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
How are you ?

234
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
How are you ?

235
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,540
How is Hubert?

236
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,220
Not bad.

237
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,420
Not bad.

238
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,280
Not bad.

239
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm going to university. And you?

240
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm going to university. And you?

241
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:53,420
Subtitles ST' 501

242
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,700
Teachers who work independently can reinvent history

243
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,980
using printed elements in a grid at the location of each work lesson.

244
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,660
By selecting and recombining the sentences they see,

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,980
They create a new storyline or a new dialogue.

246
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,940
Jack, how are you?

247
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,360
Not too good.

248
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,400
Are you sick?

249
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,860
Not too good.

250
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Are you sick?

251
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,420
Yes.

252
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,100
Yes, I am sick.

253
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,260
Fido is sick too.

254
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,400
Where are you going?

255
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,480
I'm going to the library.

256
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,400
Bye.

257
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,660
Students who can work with partners can enact their reinvention.

258
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,420
For example, after watching these scenes...

259
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,040
Hello, miss.

260
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,120
Hello, Miss Mireille. How are you?

261
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,980
Okay. Goodbye.

262
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,460
Goodbye, miss.

263
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,480
Hello, my dear Mireille. How are you?

264
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,120
I'm fine, thank you. And you, how are you?

265
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,880
Oh, I'm not doing well.

266
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,780
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell? Are you sick?

267
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:08,080
No, I'm not sick. I'm not feeling well. I'm tired.

268
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,640
Students can have fun combining them in a new dialogue, like this one.

269
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,080
Are you ready?

270
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,300
Yes.

271
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,860
Hey, hello, Mrs. Rosa.

272
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,500
Hello, Miss Mireille. How are you?

273
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,780
No, that won't do.

274
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,420
Are you feeling unwell? Are you sick?

275
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,040
No, I'm not sick, but I'm in a hurry.

276
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,840
Oh, you're going to university?

277
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,700
No, I'm not going to university, I'm going to Tahiti.

278
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,320
Hello!

279
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,600
Goodbye, Miss Mireille.

280
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,940
It's important to remember, when learning French,

281
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,560
to imitate gestures as well as words,

282
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,160
because we communicate not only with words,

283
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,160
but with our whole bodies.

284
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:55,440
Laurence Wiley Douglas Dillon, Professor Emeritus of French Civilization at Harvard

285
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:04,360
The university explains that the longer I've learned French over a long period of my life, the more I've realized the importance of communication.

286
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,160
It doesn't just come through words, it comes from the whole body and I have become more and more

287
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,180
I'm interested in this and I think it's incredibly important to learn to communicate in French.

288
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:28,540
Take for instance, the first scene you're going to see, it shows Mireille Ballot coming out of her apartment house, coming around the corner fast because she's on her way to an Italian class and she's late.

289
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,240
And there, it's her best friend who is in a cafe with three or four other people.

290
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,380
So, of course, she stops and moves away from each of them and gives her friend a kiss.

291
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,140
But she needs to be run, so what does she do?

292
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,200
She walks away with them all again.

293
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:54,920
This seems very strange to Americans, but it is very important to maintain a relationship with the French to learn these kinds of things.

294
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:01,120
People have a need to communicate with other parts of their body.

295
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,260
Jean-Pierre is the kind of person who can't break anything without putting his whole self into it.

296
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,200
But the way he uses his body is very stylized.

297
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,120
That is to say, he uses all the gestures that other people make, but he uses more of them.

298
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:23,380
For example, when they ask him if he is going to be a doctor or something like that, he says "No way" in English and in French.

299
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:42,680
Jean-Pierre

300
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,900
Robert is tired. He stops ordering a rooster, sir.

301
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,600
To pay him, he takes out his bill and hands over a note for 500 francs.

302
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,560
500 francs is 100 dollars, to pay for this small sandwich.

303
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,480
And the guy at the table, who's pointing towards the sky, you know, testing.

304
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,460
What a long-standing situation there. Oh dear.

305
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,760
Oh, yes, 500 francs.

306
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:41,540
The great advantage you have now, which I didn't have when I was learning French in the old Frasier and Square grammar, where there were only conjugations and so on, is that you can actually see people acting and see their bodies moving, and see their bodies moving in time with their voices.

307
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:54,080
And if you really pay attention to this and you're in this rhythm, you're going to learn to speak French, you're going to learn to communicate much better than I did when I had the opportunity to learn conjugations.

308
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:01,540
When learning to communicate in French with "French in Action", remember that in each lesson you will hear a large number of French people.

309
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,960
But you are warned that the first time you will only hear a part of what you hear, and to use an even smaller part.

310
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,640
part, your ability to understand and speak French will improve steadily if you remember

311
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:30,880
the rules of the game. Observe, imitate, speak up, and practice.

312
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,360
I don't think that I could have achieved any level of French proficiency if I hadn't

313
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,220
I practiced it. I took it on myself for at least part of each day.

314
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,800
either I was jogging or I was talking to my cat, trying to do it in French.

315
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,140
Do this on a consistent basis, not studying French every other day.

316
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,620
but studying French every day, perhaps for less time, but consistently.

317
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,840
Learning a language is like preparing for a piano concert.

318
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,920
or paint a picture, or sculpt a sculpture.

319
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,680
You cannot compress the experience.

320
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,580
You can't expect it to take place over 5 or 6 days,

321
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,320
and then at the end of cramping up for an exam or exercise of that kind.

322
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,360
Practice was the key.

323
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,560
The development is gradual, but there is very quickly an incredible understanding.

324
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,500
I had a lot of fun doing it.

325
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,080
I was in France and Switzerland for a while, and I made a lot of friends there.

326
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,880
and I promised to return to France as soon as I could.

327
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,740
I have a friend in Switzerland who is quite impressed by the fact that,

328
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:39,840
Then, well, when it was just after a year, I was able to hold a reasonable conversation with her, with more than just basic vocabulary.

329
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,400
I think if I went to a French country, I would do well now.

330
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,820
French in Action gives students access to hundreds of people who speak French.

331
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,160
Thousands of real-life situations.

332
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,420
Millions of individual images of contemporary France.

333
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,100
The result is a tool for communicating in French.

334
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,560
which is sophisticated and current.

335
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,860
In addition, French in Action gives learners

336
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,800
an overview of French culture,

337
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,660
the past and the present.

338
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,520
This cultural insight is what makes

339
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,260
A really effective and fun study of France.

340
00:26:32,740 --> 00:27:01,740
...

341
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:29,740
...

342
00:27:31,740 --> 00:28:01,720
French subtitles?

343
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:31,720
