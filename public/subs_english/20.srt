2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,340
and absorb it.

3
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,740
Very soon, you will see what happens

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,180
and you will be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,760
Beyond their third apartment, Robert and Mireille discuss education.

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,480
Robert argues that learning at school is useless.

7
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,220
Mireille is distancing herself from education and culture.

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,460
No one seems to notice that a man in black

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,320
took an interest in their conversation.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,660
It is 11:45 on the observatory clock

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,200
Robert and Mireille are still on the terrace of Elila's garden.

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,100
They are drinking their third kirsch

13
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,760
So you think we teach a lot of useless things?

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,700
But what, for example?

15
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,280
Well, I don't know.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,600
Almost everything.

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,920
Take mathematics, for example.

18
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,220
Geometry, trigonometry, integral calculus, differential calculus.

19
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,560
What's the point of all this?

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,080
Once you know how to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, that's all you need.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,060
And besides, now, with small electronic calculators and computers,

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,200
There's no point in even learning to count anymore.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,680
Yes, but still, computers need to be programmed.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,480
It's the same for chemistry.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,800
All these formulas, what's the point, I ask you?

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,620
This might be good if you want to be a distiller or a pharmacist.

27
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,040
Or to refine heroin

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,360
But apart from that

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
It can also be used if you want to make explosives.

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,500
Unfortunately, I've always had bad grades in chemistry.

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,760
I've always hated chemistry

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,740
All these acids, it's smoking, it smells bad

33
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,100
Chemistry is the devil's cooking

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:41,760
And all the laws of physics are the same thing.

35
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,480
What good is it to know the law of falling bodies when you fall from a balcony?

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,680
It should be noted that when he was 10 years old, Robert fell from a balcony in New Orleans and spent three weeks in the hospital.

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,800
And Latin? You studied Latin, didn't you?

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,500
Yes, six years. From sixth grade to first grade.

39
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,540
Well then, do you speak Latin?

40
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,320
No, not really.

41
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,980
No, of course not. You studied Latin for six years, but you don't speak Latin.

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,840
Besides, even if you spoke Latin, who can you speak Latin with?

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,140
I ask you. Even at the Latin home, right in the Latin Quarter, they don't speak Latin.

44
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,540
Ave Janitor.

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,120
Okay, yes, nobody speaks Latin anymore. Even priests say Mass in French now. But people learn Latin for other reasons.

46
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,180
Oh really? And why is that, tell me?

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,680
Well, to learn French better and also for intellectual discipline.

48
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,440
Intellectual discipline? Intellectual discipline? You make me laugh with your intellectual discipline.

49
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,760
If you want my opinion, doing crosswords in Geobridge is more useful than a mental exercise.

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,080
But still, there is some beautiful Latin literature.

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,040
Oh dear, literature is fiction, lies, nothing but things that don't exist.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,600
Does all this mythology actually exist?

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,740
Have you ever seen mermaids and centaurs?

54
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,300
And then, what has ever spoken towards, as in your classical tragedies?

55
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,940
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la.

56
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,600
Come on, that's ridiculous.

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,620
It's artificial; there's nothing more artificial than a classical tragedy.

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,900
Even novels are not life, they are fiction.

59
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,340
So why don't you like history?

60
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,840
At least this is about real people, people who have lived.

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,340
people who influenced events.

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,420
Ah! If you believe that history tells you the truth, you are mistaken.

63
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,280
History has conspired to make you adopt the prejudices of your nation.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,380
Your country is always right and others are always wrong.

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,780
But then, modern languages, at least that's useful, right?

66
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,500
Not the way they are taught, with all those conjugations, declensions, and vocabulary lists.

67
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,260
That's ridiculous, it's pointless.

68
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,980
We learn grammar rules for four years and we are not able to say two understandable sentences.

69
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,960
Well, I'm exaggerating. I had some very good German teachers.

70
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,900
But I don't know how to ask what time the train arrives.

71
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,180
It's true that you're exaggerating. You're funny, but you're exaggerating.

72
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,080
Besides, everyone has always been against the education they received.

73
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,040
Fortunately, culture is what remains when everything else is forgotten.

74
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,860
Oh, are you judgmental when you get going?

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
May I invite you to lunch?

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,240
Is it because I'm judgmental that you want to invite me to lunch?

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,160
No, it's because I'm hungry, because it's almost noon.

78
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,820
Because I believe you must be hungry, and so am I.

79
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
that the conversation interests me and that you want to continue it.

80
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,460
That's a lot of good reasons, but I can't accept it.

81
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,340
I go home for lunch every day.

82
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,820
It's a shame.

83
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,960
What time is it? Do you have the time?

84
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
It is five minutes to noon.

85
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,060
Oh dear, I'm going to be late.

86
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
Excuse me, I'm off.

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,860
Oh no, no, no, don't bother, see you soon. Goodbye.

88
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:23,260
Okay, now Mireille has just left

89
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,560
She has just left the Lilac Glossary

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,180
But in the beginning, where are Mireille and Robert?

91
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,600
They are still on the terrace of the glossary

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
They've been there for a long time, a long time.

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,760
They had time to drink two kirs.

94
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,560
And now they're drinking their third kir.

95
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,260
They are drinking their third kia.

96
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,320
Look at Marie-Laure over there. What is she doing?

97
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,180
She is learning her lesson.

98
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,060
And what is Mr. Bello doing here?

99
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,160
He is reading the newspaper.

100
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,120
And what do the Bellos do now?

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,580
They are eating.

102
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,020
Robert and Mireille are on the terrace of the Closerie des Lilas.

103
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,600
They are drinking their third kia.

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,420
And Robert is criticizing the teaching.

105
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,000
So, you think we teach a lot of useless things?

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
What for example?

107
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,380
Well, I don't know. Almost everything.

108
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,880
He criticizes everything. Well, almost everything.

109
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,940
Look at Marie-Laure. Has she finished her homework?

110
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,200
Not quite. Almost.

111
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,860
Have you finished your homework?

112
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,460
Almost.

113
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,400
That's it, I'm finished.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:48,420
And here, she ate almost all the chocolates.

115
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,600
Did you eat all the chocolates?

116
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
No, not all

117
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,840
Yes, well, almost all of them

118
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,520
Robert criticizes mathematics

119
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,000
He says it's pointless

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,720
Geometry, trigonometry, integral calculus

121
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,960
Differential calculus, what's the point of all that?

122
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
It's pointless, it's not useful.

123
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,860
A pencil, yes. A pencil, now that's useful.

124
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,980
A pencil is for writing.

125
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,460
A corkscrew is useful.

126
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
It's used to uncork bottles.

127
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,320
A knife is useful.

128
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,180
It's used for cutting.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,100
A watch is useful.

130
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
It's used to tell the time.

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,940
Glasses are useful.

132
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,760
Because it's used for reading.

133
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,300
But a tie is not useful.

134
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,080
It's pointless.

135
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,100
And mathematics is like a tie.

136
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,240
It's pointless.

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,220
Finally, Robert says it's pointless.

138
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,100
But not everyone agrees.

139
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,680
I find mathematics very useful.

140
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,420
What do you think about math?

141
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,620
Is it useful?

142
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,280
Very useful.

143
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,180
Do you think math is useful?

144
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,880
Yes, I think so.

145
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,780
Of course, you need to know how to do addition.

146
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,500
Do you know how to do addition?

147
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,300
Yes, I do. I know how to do addition.

148
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,160
Here, look.

149
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:23,060
28 plus 14, for example, 8 and 4, 12, I write down 2 and carry over 1, 2 and 1, 3 and 1, 4, 42.

150
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,420
You also need to know how to do subtraction.

151
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,860
32 minus 16

152
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,920
6 subtracted from 12

153
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,900
That makes 6

154
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
and I retain 1

155
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,200
1 and 1, 2 subtracted from 3

156
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,380
There's 1 left, that makes 16

157
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,500
You also need to know how to do it.

158
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
a multiplication

159
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,640
43 multiplied by 12 for example

160
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,480
That makes 2 times 3.6

161
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,900
6, 2 times 4

162
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,420
8

163
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,500
1 times 3, 3

164
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,860
1 times 4, 4

165
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:02,260
4, 6, 8 and 3, 11, 4 and 1, 5.

166
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,260
You also need to know how to do division.

167
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,960
436 divided by 8, let's see, that makes 43, how many times 8?

168
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,760
5 times 8, 40.

169
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,400
5 times 8, 40, subtracted from 43, remainder 3.

170
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:33,880
It's 6, 36, in 36, how many times? 8, 4 times, 8 times 4, 32, top of 36, remainder 4.

171
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,340
That makes 54 and there are 4 left.

172
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,920
Me, my friend, I can do everything.

173
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,660
You need to know how to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

174
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,600
But that's all. That's all that's needed. That's enough.

175
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,300
And besides, now, with small electronic calculators and computers, there's no need to even learn to count anymore.

176
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,560
Besides, now, with small calculators and computers, there's no need to learn to count anymore.

177
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,360
It's not worth it. It's pointless. There's no need to learn to count. It's not worth it.

178
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,600
Thanks anyway.

179
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,180
There's no need to thank me.

180
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,140
According to Robert, chemistry is also useless.

181
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,420
What's the point of all these formulas? I ask you.

182
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,240
This might be good if you want to be a distiller or a pharmacist.

183
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,620
or to refine heroin.

184
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,440
But apart from that...

185
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,680
This might be useful if you want to be a distiller.

186
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,040
if we want to distill alcohol or perfumes,

187
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,280
or if we want to refine heroin.

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,860
Heroin is a drug like cocaine, hashish, opium, all that stuff.

189
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,460
Chemistry might be useful if we want to refine oil.

190
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:56,080
Or if we want to make explosives, Molotov cocktails, dynamite, atomic bombs, all that.

191
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,200
Chemistry is used for all sorts of things.

192
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,160
What is it for?

193
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:08,040
It is used to make pharmaceutical products, dyes, and many everyday objects.

194
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,460
Is it fun to watch?

195
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,200
Chemistry is used to manufacture plastics.

196
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,120
Here, they manufacture train cars.

197
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,320
At Citroën, they manufacture cars

198
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,380
And that's Mireille, the one who makes explosives.

199
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,880
Unfortunately, I've always had bad grades in chemistry.

200
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,180
I've always hated chemistry

201
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,420
Mireille doesn't like chemistry

202
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,540
She hates that

203
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,460
Listen Elsa, if there was anything, you know you'd be the first person I'd tell.

204
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,120
That's not right, is it? I hate breaking up. That's clever.

205
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,960
Mireille has always hated chemistry because it smells bad.

206
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,060
All these acids, they're smoking, they smell bad. Chemistry is the devil's cooking.

207
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,820
She hates chemistry because there are always fuming acids. It fumes, it smells bad.

208
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:14,460
That smells good. Perfumes smell good.

209
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,040
Fabric softener smells nice too.

210
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,280
And besides, at our house, everyone loves the smell of vanilla fabric softener.

211
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Mustard has a strong smell.

212
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,940
It's the verb "to feel".

213
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
Listen, it smells funny.

214
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,240
That smells funny.

215
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,820
Is it you who smells like that?

216
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:40,740
"All these acids, they're smoking, they smell bad. Chemistry is the devil's cooking."

217
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,480
According to Robert, physics is also useless.

218
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,900
"What good is knowing the law of falling bodies if you fall from a balcony?"

219
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,160
In physics, we learn the law of falling bodies.

220
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,720
But if you fall from a balcony, knowing the law of falling bodies is useless.

221
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:07,100
When he was ten years old, Robert was with his parents in New Orleans and he fell from a balcony.

222
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,020
He stayed in the hospital for three weeks.

223
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,280
Look, he too fell from a balcony. He took a tumble.

224
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,140
That too is a fall. It's a waterfall. It's falling water.

225
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,160
In high school, we study Latin.

226
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,720
But, according to Robert, there's no point in studying Latin.

227
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,100
Because we study it for years, but we don't know it well enough to talk about it.

228
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,080
But we learn Latin for other reasons.

229
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Oh really? And why is that, tell me?

230
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
Well, to learn French better.

231
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,860
Latin is useful for learning to speak French better, for example.

232
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,280
In the past, people spoke Latin.

233
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,460
But now it's over. We don't speak Latin anymore.

234
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,780
Even Latin men are not spoken to in Latin.

235
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,480
If you say hello to the receptionist in Latin, he won't understand you.

236
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,180
And yet, the Latin home is in the Latin Quarter, right in the heart of the Latin Quarter.

237
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:12,600
Here is Paris, here is the Latin Quarter, and here is the Latin Home right in the middle of the Latin Quarter, right in the heart of the Latin Quarter, right in the middle.

238
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,180
Spot on.

239
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:22,540
And look at the ball there, right in the glass, right in

240
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,580
The Latin home is right in the Latin Quarter

241
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,740
And yet, Latin is not spoken at the Latin home

242
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,740
In the past, parish priests, Catholic priests, said Mass in Latin

243
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,140
Our Father

244
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,620
But now they say Mass in French.

245
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,960
Our Father

246
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,100
Today, we no longer learn Latin in order to speak Latin, no

247
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:52,300
But we learn Latin for intellectual discipline, because it is a good mental exercise.

248
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,020
It makes you work your head, it makes you use your brain.

249
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,380
Gymnastics is a physical exercise.

250
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,380
Learning Latin is a mental exercise.

251
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,880
Here is a gentleman who does a lot of physical exercise, but not much mental exercise.

252
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,800
You make me laugh with your intellectual discipline.

253
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,980
You make me laugh.

254
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,040
Look at Madame Hello.

255
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,660
She reads Asterix and it makes her laugh.

256
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,780
And here, Uncle Guillaume is jumping rope and it makes Marie-Laure laugh.

257
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,860
Whereas there is somewhere a surefire way to find a guy who would be delighted if you cooked him two fried eggs.

258
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,040
Ah, you're laughing.

259
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,360
Yes, that makes her laugh.

260
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,180
That makes them laugh.

261
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:46,500
Okay, now you're going to imitate Robert in his conversation with Mireille.

262
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,260
Listen carefully to what Robert says.

263
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,240
Okay, yes, nobody speaks Latin anymore.

264
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,940
Even priests say mass in French now.

265
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,180
But we learn Latin for other reasons.

266
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh really? And why is that, tell me?

267
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,900
Well, to learn French better and also for intellectual discipline.

268
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,260
You make me laugh with your intellectual discipline.

269
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,780
Now, it's your turn.

270
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:15,240
Okay, yes, nobody speaks Latin anymore. Even priests say Mass in French now. But people learn Latin for other reasons.

271
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:25,840
Oh really? And why, tell me? Oh really? And why, tell me? Oh really? And why, tell me?

272
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,020
Well, to learn French better, and also for intellectual discipline.

273
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,100
You make me laugh with your intellectual discipline. You make me laugh with your intellectual discipline.

274
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,600
You make me laugh with your intellectual discipline.

275
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,600
According to Robert, doing crossword puzzles is more useful as a mental exercise than learning Latin.

276
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Robert likes doing crossword puzzles.

277
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,820
In his opinion, it's a very good mental exercise.

278
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,000
That's his opinion. That's Robert's opinion. That's his view.

279
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,760
In his opinion, in my opinion, in your opinion.

280
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,280
Robert is very kind.

281
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,960
In my opinion, you should marry her.

282
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm not asking for your opinion. Mind your own business.

283
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,520
Which do you think, this one or that one?

284
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,020
In my opinion, that one.

285
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,800
So, Manon, you don't like it?

286
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,020
Non.

287
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,360
Ah, well, I am indeed his friend.

288
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,760
Robert criticizes Latin literature.

289
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,880
In his opinion, it's all lies.

290
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,200
It's fiction.

291
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,520
Mythology, sirens, centaurs, they don't exist

292
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,520
These are lies, it's not true.

293
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,460
Mom, Marie-La ate all the cookies again

294
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,140
That's not true, that's a lie, it wasn't me

295
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:57,180
You're still eating chocolates.

296
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,960
No, I didn't eat chocolate, I worked.

297
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,840
Oh yes, is that a true lie?

298
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,000
Marie-Laure says she was working, but that's a lie, it's not true.

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,240
According to Robert, classical tragedies are ridiculous because everyone speaks in verse.

300
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,240
Tragedies are in verse.

301
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,860
Here are some verses, and here is some prose.

302
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,140
Literature, classical tragedies, novels, it's artificial, it's fiction.

303
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,740
So why don't you like history?

304
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,000
At least this is about real people, people who lived, people who influenced events.

305
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,600
The story is about real people.

306
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:48,280
Joan of Arc, Louis XIV, Napoleon, these are real people, people who lived.

307
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,540
Now they are dead, but they lived, from the verb "to live".

308
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,700
It's the past tense of "vivre" (to live).

309
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,300
They lived, they lived.

310
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:05,280
Pantagruel is not a real person, he is fictional.

311
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,000
He didn't really live

312
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,900
But Louis XIV is a real person, a historical figure

313
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,840
He actually lived

314
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,180
He had an influence on historical events.

315
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,540
If you believe that history tells you the truth, you are mistaken.

316
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,420
History has conspired to make you adopt the prejudices of your nation

317
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,860
History does not tell the truth

318
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,440
History has been manipulated, rewritten. History distorts the truth.

319
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,680
The truth, the truth, what is the truth?

320
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:48,380
There are several truths. There is a French truth, there is a German truth, an American truth, a Russian truth.

321
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,600
Finally, we can say that truth is the opposite of a lie.

322
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:13,000
"Lies, truth." But everyone sees truth differently. Do you know how the French represent truth? They represent truth as a naked young woman emerging from a well, holding a mirror. That's truth at the Palais de Justice in Paris.

323
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:22,300
Robert criticizes history, but he also criticizes modern languages ​​because they are taught poorly.

324
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,540
We teach conjugations, we teach declensions, we teach grammar rules,

325
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:33,280
but the students are not able to say two understandable sentences.

326
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,020
Robert is unable to ask what time the train arrives.

327
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,980
And you? Do you know how to ask what time the train arrives in French?

328
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,960
What time does the train arrive?

329
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,320
Very well, you know how to ask what time the train arrives

330
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,140
Robert is against everything, nothing pleases him

331
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,080
And you, are you against education or are you for it?

332
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,180
Do you enjoy studying?

333
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,860
Work: are you against it or for it?

334
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,320
And what about art and artists? Are you for or against them?

335
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,660
"Oh, you're an artist. I forgot."

336
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,200
"What do you have against artists? We need them."

337
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,520
Robert, on the other hand, is against everything.

338
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,220
He criticizes everything.

339
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,740
He puts on a little show to impress Mireille.

340
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,940
Robert exaggerates in his criticism of the education he received.

341
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,000
"Besides, everyone has always been against the education they received."

342
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,680
The education he received, received, is the verb to receive.

343
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,800
We receive an education, we receive a package.

344
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,380
Look, Mireille here, she's receiving a package.

345
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,180
We receive gifts, we receive letters.

346
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,760
Now listen to Mireille, she's going to be a bit pompous, a bit sententious.

347
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,360
Fortunately, culture is what remains when everything else is forgotten.

348
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,700
"Oh, are you judgmental when you put your foot down?"

349
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,480
Generally, Mireille is not judgmental.

350
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,080
She speaks normally, simply.

351
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,600
But when she gets going, when she starts to be sententious,

352
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,020
Then, she can be very judgmental.

353
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,860
Robert invites Mireille to lunch because he is hungry.

354
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,140
He is hungry.

355
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,300
Marie-Laure is hungry.

356
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,260
She eats because she is hungry.

357
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,460
But here, she is not hungry.

358
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,920
Well, eat.

359
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm not hungry.

360
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,140
She's not hungry.

361
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,880
Here's another person who isn't hungry.

362
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,460
Aren't you hungry?

363
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,960
You really don't want a croissant?

364
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,180
I'm not hungry.

365
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,300
I'm hungry, I'm not hungry, that's the expression "to be hungry".

366
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,520
Robert has many good reasons to invite Mireille to lunch.

367
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,460
But she cannot accept because her parents are expecting her for lunch at noon.

368
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,820
It's already five to twelve, she's going to be late.

369
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,040
Then she gets up and leaves.

370
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,400
Oh dear, I'm going to be late.

371
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,320
Excuse me, I need to film.

372
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,800
Notice, Robert invited Mireille.

373
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,540
Robert invited her.

374
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:45,020
And now he's invited Mireille and Colette. He's invited Mireille and Colette, he's invited them. Interesting, isn't it? Okay, now watch, think, and talk.

375
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,160
What do we do at Citroën?

376
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,020
Are we refining oil or manufacturing cars?

377
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
We manufacture cars.

378
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,480
Look at this.

379
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,220
Does it smell good?

380
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,180
No, it smells bad.

381
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,260
It stinks.

382
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,020
Look, what happened to this man?

383
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,140
He fell from a balcony.

384
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,020
Is the Latin home far from the Latin Quarter?

385
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,880
No, it's right in the Latin Quarter.

386
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,780
Look at Robert here. What is he doing?

387
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,500
He does crossword puzzles.

388
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,300
In your opinion, is doing crossword puzzles a good form of physical exercise?

389
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,240
No, but it's a good mental exercise.

390
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:45,320
Are Joan of Arc and Napoleon fictional characters or real people?

391
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,420
These are people who have lived.

392
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,540
Do you know how to ask in French what time the train arrives?

393
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,900
What do you say if you want to know what time the train arrives?

394
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,240
You say...

395
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,560
What time does the train arrive?

396
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,040
That's it.

397
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:22,480
There you go. Look at Marie-Laure here. Is she hungry or does she have a toothache? She's hungry. Now, look. Why does the teacher always wear a tie? What's the point? I ask you.

398
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,540
Why is it pointless? Why do you always have a stick? What's it for?

399
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,480
It's useful, but it's very helpful, Mr. Robert.

400
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:38,160
No, but yes, why is there no point in arguing with these people?

401
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm off, goodbye, see you soon.

402
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:21,480
