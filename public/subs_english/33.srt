3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,860
Thursday evening, Bélots' apartment.

4
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,420
That's Hubert. I recognize his ring of the doorbell.

5
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,820
Madame Bélot will open.

6
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,020
My respects, madam.

7
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,020
Hubert, what a pleasure to see you.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,440
Thank you for your beautiful bouquet.

9
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,700
Please, madam, it's the least I can do.

10
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,240
I know you like roses.

11
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,720
You really shouldn't have.

12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,240
Sir.

13
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,400
Good evening, Hubert.

14
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,180
Good evening.

15
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,560
Good evening, Hubert.

16
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,780
Hello, you.

17
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,480
Good evening, Colette.

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,680
Good evening.

19
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,780
How are you ?

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,760
It's fine. You look as fresh as a daisy.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,760
Mireille introduces Robert to Hubert.

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,340
Robert, Hubert.

23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,220
Good evening.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:07,160
Everyone to the table

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,300
And everyone heads towards the dining room

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,520
Let's see, Mr. Taylor is on my right.

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,980
Hubert is on my left.

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,000
Colette and Mireille next to Hubert

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,040
You, Marie-Laure, next to Dad

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,640
Everyone settles in.

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,080
Thank you Hubert

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,840
This deer.

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,120
A little more foie gras, Mr. Taylor.

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,340
I'd love that, it's delicious.

35
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,240
It was Mrs. Courtois' mother who did it herself.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,140
Marie-Laure, please sit down, or you'll have to go to your room?

37
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:55,780
During the meal, Robert is a little surprised by Hubert's way of speaking.

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Rest assured that I fully share your opinion, sir.

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,980
You have the kindness to believe me, dear lady.

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,260
Please pass me the salt.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,640
Dear sir, please be aware that good wine can only be found in France.

42
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,660
Is there any good wine around Provins?

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,480
For great wines, you have to go a little further, all the way to Burgundy.

44
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,580
Yes, Beaune, Alex Corton, Nuit-Saint-Georges,

45
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,880
Bonne Romanée, Vougeot, Chambault-le-Musigny,

46
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,140
Geoffrey-Chambertin, Fixin.

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,380
Yes, yes, I know it very well.

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,980
Excellent, excellent.

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,120
If I understand correctly, miss, you live in Provence?

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,440
Yes, but I come to Paris often.

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,880
Almost every day, in fact.

52
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,500
I understand.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,780
The provinces must be a bit boring.

54
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,040
Oh no, not at all.

55
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,440
You know, between Paris and the provinces,

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,780
Personally, I think I prefer the provinces.

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,700
I like Provence.

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,840
Provinces aside, I prefer Provence to Provins.

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,600
That's stupid

60
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,980
Marie-Laure, please be quiet, behave yourself

61
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,040
Oh, if we can't even laugh anymore now

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,140
Our villa is not very big

63
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,060
But we have a small garden with a few apple trees at the end

64
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,460
It's pleasant, you feel at home, behind the wings, the walls, the gate

65
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,340
It's the countryside, and yet I'm in Paris in an hour or more

66
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,040
So, how's the construction going? Is business good?

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
Oh, don't even mention it to me.

68
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,780
My uncles are in charge of it, but they're not doing anything particularly fascinating.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,140
We did quite a few interesting things.

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:39,460
Look at La Défense, Beaubourg, La Villette, the Palais Omnisport de Bercy, the Opéra de la Bastille, the Grand Louvre, the Forum des Halles.

71
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,960
But they, my uncles, they only build rabbit hutches, council flats, workers' housing.

72
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,120
You know the type.

73
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,220
What do you want?

74
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,980
Nowadays, it's only for the working class.

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,620
The workers want to have mains drainage, running water, central heating, gas, electricity, all modern comforts.

76
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,000
They need dishwashers, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, televisions, lives of garbage.

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:15,600
But only 100 years ago, all these people lived 10 to a room without lighting, with water from a pump and the toilets at the bottom of the yard.

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,880
He managed very, very well without a bathtub or bidet.

79
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,120
He wasn't any more unhappy because of it

80
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,140
Robert couldn't help but intervene

81
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,740
He wasn't any more unhappy because of it?

82
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,960
That's what you say, sir.

83
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm not so sure about that

84
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,820
I'd like to see you, ten to a room in a filthy hovel.

85
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,080
Without your daily bath or shower

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,840
Without your phone, your elevator, or your servants

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm not sure you'd be that happy about that.

88
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,540
Know that the working class has the same rights to comfort

89
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,440
than the descendants of the oppressors of the Middle Ages.

90
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,920
Regarding the Middle Ages,

91
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Did you go see the exhibition?

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,520
Carolingian manuscripts at the Petit Palais?

93
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,240
Today, we are getting to know Hubert.

94
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,700
Here he comes.

95
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,100
That's Hubert.

96
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,100
I recognize his ringing of the doorbell.

97
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,160
Marie-Laure recognizes him immediately, even without seeing him, just from his ringing of the doorbell, which is unlike any other.

98
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,900
Hubert is not like everyone else. First of all, he is very polite, excessively polite even.

99
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,600
My respects, madam.

100
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,520
My compliments, oh, that sounds very nice, very distinguished. My compliments go with the kiss.

101
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:37,920
Look.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,760
Are we leaving already?

103
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,520
Yes, it's sorted, it's sorted.

104
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
Allow me, I will now pay my respects to the lady.

105
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,420
My respects, madam.

106
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,400
Hubert, what a pleasure to see you.

107
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
Thank you for your beautiful bouquet.

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,080
But please, madam, it's the least I can do.

109
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,620
I know you like roses.

110
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,100
But really, you shouldn't have.

111
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,900
But please, madam, it's the least I can do.

112
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,060
But please, madam, it's the least I can do.

113
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,620
I know you like roses.

114
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,940
Ah, Hubert has very good manners.

115
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,720
Good manners are very important.

116
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
Madame Belleau is very particular about good manners.

117
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,740
Marie-Laure doesn't always have very good manners.

118
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,180
Here, do you remember?

119
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,900
It's American!

120
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,500
Come on, Marie-Laure, will you be polite? What's with these manners?

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,540
She doesn't always have very good table manners.

122
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,780
Marie-Laure, please sit down, or you'll have to go to your room?

123
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,320
Look, she's not standing properly, she's standing badly.

124
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,400
Marie-Laure, hold on tight

125
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,280
She is not polite.

126
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,680
How stupid he is!

127
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,540
Marie-Laure, please be quiet. Sit down.

128
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,660
Shut up.

129
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,380
Be quiet.

130
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,980
Stop talking.

131
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,380
There are circumstances in which one should not speak.

132
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,060
We must remain silent.

133
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,660
In the cinema, for example.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,440
Because it bothers others. Observe.

135
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,020
I'll draw you a little picture.

136
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,540
But be quiet now.

137
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,260
Chut!

138
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,780
Those two aren't going to shut up anytime soon.

139
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,240
Because there are some ill-mannered people out there, after all.

140
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,260
Chut!

141
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,560
Be quiet. Listen.

142
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,000
Hush, hush, be quiet. Listen.

143
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,360
Be quiet for a bit.

144
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,980
Marie-Laure is sometimes ill-mannered, but Hubert, on the other hand, is very well-mannered, very polite, very distinguished.

145
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,320
He speaks well, very well, in a somewhat pretentious, mannered, affected way.

146
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,520
For example, he doesn't say "okay" or "I agree".

147
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,420
No, he said, rest assured that I completely share your opinion.

148
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,840
Rest assured that I fully share your opinion, sir.

149
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,480
Be sure, be, that's the imperative of the verb to be.

150
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:04,280
Or, he doesn't simply say, believe me, but please be kind enough to believe me, dear lady.

151
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,380
Please be kind enough to believe me.

152
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,040
Please believe me

153
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,860
Would you be so kind as to believe me, dear lady?

154
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,220
"Ayez" is the imperative form of the verb "avoir" (to have).

155
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't be afraid, miss

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,260
He didn't say either

157
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,640
Can you pass me the salt?

158
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,940
But please be so kind as to pass me the salt, miss.

159
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,500
Please be so kind

160
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,240
Please be so kind as to pass me the salt

161
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,360
Please pass me the salt, miss.

162
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,200
Please, this is the imperative form of the verb "to want".

163
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,200
He also said, "Know that there is no good wine except in France."

164
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,880
Remember that good wine can only be found in France.

165
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,760
"Sachez" is the imperative form of the verb "savoir".

166
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,660
You should know that good wine only comes from France.

167
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,060
Hubert is a bit of a chauvinist.

168
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,100
They think everything is better in France, especially the wines.

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,240
In France, there are good wines. In other countries, there are no good wines.

170
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,100
Are there good wines in Spain?

171
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,740
Yes !

172
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,060
Hubert said no. There are only good wines in France.

173
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,680
Are there good wines in Norway? No.

174
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,680
Are there good wines in Germany? No.

175
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,780
Are there good wines in England? No.

176
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,940
No, no, no, no, there are only good wines in France.

177
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,420
In France only, nowhere else but in France.

178
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,820
Robert tries to make conversation with Colette.

179
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,660
If I understand correctly, miss, you live in Provence?

180
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,420
Yes, but I come to Paris often. Almost every day, in fact.

181
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,320
I understand. Life in the provinces must be a bit boring.

182
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,340
Oh no, not at all. You know, between Paris and the provinces, I think I prefer the provinces.

183
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,600
It is important to know that France is divided into two parts.

184
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,040
Paris and the provinces.

185
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:23,420
Toulouse is in the provinces. Lyon is in the provinces. Bordeaux is in the provinces. Brest is in the provinces. Marseille is in the provinces. Paris is Paris. But the provinces are the provinces.

186
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:33,920
It is sometimes said that Paris is more lively, more interesting, and that the provinces are a bit boring, a bit dead.

187
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:43,400
But there are many people who prefer the provinces, because it is calmer, more peaceful, more picturesque.

188
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,220
Colette, for example, prefers the provinces.

189
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,440
You know, between Paris and the provinces, I think I prefer the provinces. I like the provinces.

190
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,640
Province for province, I prefer Provence to Provins.

191
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,020
That's stupid.

192
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,920
Marie-Laure laughed because she understood.

193
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,160
She understood Hubert's wordplay.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,220
She's not stupid, that little girl.

195
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,060
Come on, Colette likes Provins and the provinces.

196
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,980
Provins is in the provinces.

197
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,800
Okay, but there are a lot of provinces.

198
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,400
Alsace is a province.

199
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:30,980
Burgundy is a province. Normandy is a province. Aquitaine is a province. And Provence is also a province.

200
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:39,320
If he had to choose between Provins and Provence, Hubert would choose Provence.

201
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:46,900
Note that Provins isn't bad. It's quite a pretty little town, rather picturesque.

202
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,260
There are very old monuments like this tower which dates back to Roman times

203
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,760
It's a rather pretty provincial town

204
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,920
So, it's a province, but it's a rather pleasant province.

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,900
But obviously the provinces aren't bad either.

206
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,180
There is sunshine, olive trees, and fountains.

207
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:41,380
There are small picturesque villages, hilltop villages with old houses, the beautiful ones of Provence, there are old churches, bell towers, squares with plane trees, people playing boules, flowers, the sea.

208
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,640
Hubert prefers Provence, but Colette prefers Provins.

209
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,780
It's very close to Paris, but it's the countryside.

210
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,960
The city, the countryside.

211
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,820
The city, the countryside.

212
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,380
The city, the countryside.

213
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,260
The city, the countryside.

214
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:25,320
In Provins, Colette lives in a villa, a house with a garden around it. Here's a small villa. Here are some villas. There's a garden with flowers, vegetables, and apple trees.

215
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,300
Apple trees at the end of the garden, at the back of the garden.

216
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:40,360
We feel at home because the garden is enclosed by hedges, gates, and walls.

217
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:51,680
A grid, a grid, a grid, a wall, a wall, a wall and a grid.

218
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,200
A hedge, hedges

219
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,540
It's the countryside, and yet I can be in Paris in an hour at most.

220
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,300
It takes her one hour to get to Paris.

221
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,900
Look at Marie-Laure here

222
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,960
She made this drawing in five minutes.

223
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,320
It took her five minutes to make this drawing.

224
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,440
Oh, that's very good.

225
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,640
Did it take you a long time to do that?

226
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,780
Oh, I can do that in five minutes.

227
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:25,500
Now, listen carefully to the conversation between Robert and Colette.

228
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,280
Then, you will answer Robert as if you were Colette.

229
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,120
If I understand correctly, miss, you live in Provence?

230
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,640
Yes, but I come to Paris often, almost every day in fact

231
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,920
I understand, the provinces must be a bit boring

232
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,460
Oh no, not at all

233
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,200
You know, between Paris and the provinces, I think I prefer the provinces.

234
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,720
Now, try to answer as if you were Colette.

235
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,380
If I understand correctly, miss, you live in Provence?

236
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,240
Yes, but I come to Paris often.

237
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,760
Yes, but I come to Paris often.

238
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,580
Yes, but I come to Paris often.

239
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,260
Almost every day, in fact

240
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,920
Almost every day, in fact

241
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,980
Almost every day, in fact

242
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,120
I understand

243
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,180
The provinces must be a bit boring

244
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,780
Oh no, not at all

245
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,760
Oh no, not at all

246
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,360
Oh no, not at all.

247
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,100
You know, between Paris and the provinces, I think I prefer the provinces.

248
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,440
You know, between Paris and the provinces, I think I prefer the provinces.

249
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,680
You know, between Paris and the provinces, I think I prefer the provinces.

250
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,940
Mr. Belleau brings the conversation to the topic of construction.

251
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,440
So, how's the construction going?

252
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,200
We're doing some interesting things in the field of construction.

253
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:57,000
Beaubourg, the Forum des Halles, La Défense, Marne-la-Vallée.

254
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,960
Beaubourg, the Opéra de la Bastille, that's very good.

255
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,000
The Forum is less aesthetically pleasing in terms of architecture.

256
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,240
And what about the Bercy Omnisport Arena?

257
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,880
It's very pretty.

258
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,840
I don't dislike the architecture.

259
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,840
But the Pinochambre construction company isn't doing anything interesting.

260
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:25,880
Nothing interesting, look at Marie Laure, she turns off the TV because there's nothing interesting on.

261
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:36,260
What's this? Meh, nothing interesting, the Pinot Chambrun construction company

262
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:47,360
only builds social housing, low-rent housing, cheap housing

263
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,560
For the workers. The workers, the people who work with their hands. The social housing, these apartments

264
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:02,700
Workers, it's not interesting from an architectural point of view. They're rabbit hutches. That

265
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:11,740
They look like rabbit hutches, chicken coops. They're not very attractive. But they are comfortable.

266
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:25,980
There is electricity, mains drainage, running water, central heating.

267
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,140
In the past, workers had no comforts.

268
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,440
They lived in slums without lighting or electricity.

269
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:56,000
He used kerosene lamps for light. He didn't have running water. He had to fetch water from the pump. He didn't have a toilet in the house. He had to go outside. The outhouses were in the courtyard, at the back of the courtyard.

270
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,880
At the very bottom, at the end. Do you remember?

271
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,620
The miners work at the bottom of the mine.

272
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,180
Submarines travel along the seabed.

273
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,680
There's a little wine at the bottom of the glass.

274
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,260
There are villages at the bottom of the valley.

275
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,680
Here is a village at the bottom of the valley.

276
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,360
The boy is at the back of the room.

277
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,100
The staircase is at the back of the courtyard. Listen.

278
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,060
Edward, the small door at the back on the left. Hurry up.

279
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,380
In the past, workers had no comforts.

280
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,240
But today, they need washing machines, dishwashers,

281
00:19:47,240 --> 00:20:06,580
refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, televisions, garbage chutes, garbage disposal systems, sinks, bidets, showers, bathtubs for taking baths.

282
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,380
They need all of that

283
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,220
They need all modern comforts

284
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,260
They want all the modern comforts

285
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,660
He demands it, they need it

286
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,420
Observe Myriam here

287
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,400
She is very demanding.

288
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,860
He needs a whole bunch of things

289
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,480
He needs a book

290
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,980
He needs a sheet of paper

291
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,760
He needs a pencil

292
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,160
Hey, can you pass me that book?

293
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,580
Give me that sheet of paper.

294
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,580
I need a pencil. Won't you get me one?

295
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,580
What else do you need? Do you need anything else?

296
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,580
Hubert isn't really serious.

297
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,580
He is playing a role. He is playing the role of the reactionary aristocrat.

298
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,540
In the past, workers had no comforts, but they lived very well without them.

299
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,520
They weren't any more unhappy because of it.

300
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,480
They managed very, very well without a bathtub or bidet.

301
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,700
They weren't any more unhappy because of it.

302
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,220
They didn't have all the modern comforts, but they weren't unhappy.

303
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,660
Observe what Mr. Bellou says here.

304
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,060
We are not rich, we only have one car, but we are not any less unhappy for it.

305
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,580
I wish we were as rich as Uncle William.

306
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,120
Meh, but why is that?

307
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,840
Because he has two cars and we only have one.

308
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,900
But I'm not any more unhappy about it, am I?

309
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,380
Robert is outraged.

310
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,280
He wants to intervene, to stop Hubert.

311
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,100
And he finally intervened.

312
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,220
He can't help but intervene.

313
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,120
Look at the girl here.

314
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,180
She wants to prevent the young man from intervening.

315
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,680
Robert can't help but intervene

316
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,820
Look at Marie-Laure, she wants to scratch herself.

317
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,820
She can't stop scratching herself.

318
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,340
Stop scratching

319
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,500
I can't help it

320
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,180
Robert can't help but intervene

321
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,920
Then, he intervenes

322
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,320
He wasn't any more unhappy because of it?

323
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,560
That's what you say, sir.

324
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,340
I'm not so sure about that

325
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:35,440
I would like to see you, living ten to a room in a filthy hovel, without your daily bath or shower, without your telephone, your elevator or your servants.

326
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm not sure you'd be that happy.

327
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,060
Know that the working class has the same rights to comfort as the descendants of the oppressors of the Middle Ages.

328
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,160
Robert accuses Hubert of being a descendant of the oppressors of the Middle Ages.

329
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:57,960
The oppressors of the Middle Ages were the great lords who had all the rights and who oppressed the poor people.

330
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,300
In a modern democracy, everyone has the same rights.

331
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,080
The workers have the same rights as Hubert from our bedrooms.

332
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,860
Madame Bello skillfully diverts the conversation.

333
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:21,280
Speaking of the Middle Ages, did you go see the exhibition of Carolingian manuscripts at the Petit Palais?

334
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
This is the Petit Palais where exhibitions are held.

335
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,040
And here are Carolingian manuscripts, that is to say from the time of Charlemagne, around the 8th century.

336
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,080
Okay, now let's see what we can say.

337
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,960
Listen, watch, think, and speak.

338
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:49,460
Well, first of all, you are a man, a very distinguished gentleman, very polite.

339
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:57,960
You meet a lady, you kiss her hand, and what do you say?

340
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,380
You say...

341
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,160
My respects, madam.

342
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,820
There you go, that's very good.

343
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,560
Now, Hubert, that charming boy, has given you a magnificent bouquet of roses.

344
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,240
You thank him. What do you say?

345
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
You say...

346
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,020
Thank you for your beautiful bouquet.

347
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,720
Again.

348
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,140
Thank you for your beautiful bouquet.

349
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,720
Now, you are Hubert. What is your answer?

350
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,380
Please, madam, it's the least I can do.

351
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,140
Again.

352
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,440
Please, madam, it's the least I can do.

353
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,440
"Now, your daughter is very nice, but she is a little ill-mannered."

354
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:50,340
So, your daughter leaves the table and she's not sitting properly. What do you say? What do you say?

355
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,980
"Please be quiet, behave yourself."

356
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,940
"Again."

357
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,060
"Please be quiet, behave yourself."

358
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:05,440
"According to Hubert, who's a bit of a chauvinist, you know, is there good wine everywhere?"

359
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,920
No, good wine is only found in France.

360
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,040
Mr. Courtois is absent today.

361
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,540
He is not in Paris and he is not abroad.

362
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,800
Where is he?

363
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,900
He is in the provinces.

364
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,700
Is this the city or the countryside?

365
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,300
This is the countryside.

366
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,240
Where does Colette live?

367
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,300
In an apartment or in a villa?

368
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
In a villa.

369
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,060
In your opinion, is this a worker or an oppressor from the Middle Ages?

370
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,920
A worker.

371
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,220
Is that a sink or a garbage chute?

372
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,700
A sink.

373
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,680
Do you think that in the villages of Bélots you have to fetch water from a pump or that they have running water?

374
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,440
They have running water.

375
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:33,180
But of course we have running water, we have running water, we have gas, electricity, we have central heating, a bathroom with a bathtub, a shower, a refrigerator, a television, a vacuum cleaner, a dishwasher, a garbage chute, and there you go, we can be a little bit more at ease.
