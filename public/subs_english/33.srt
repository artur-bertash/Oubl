3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,220
Thursday evening, we're still at the table at the Bélots' house.

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,980
Colette, would you like some more foie gras? You do enjoy it.

5
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Colette has run out of bread. Marie-Laure, please go and get some bread.

6
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,600
Rents must be expensive in this area.

7
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,360
Yes, quite a lot. But we don't rent. We own a condominium.

8
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,740
We bought the apartment about twenty years ago.

9
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:41,240
Each owner pays their share for heating, caretaker salaries, maintenance, repairs, and periodic facade cleaning.

10
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,400
But overall, even with all the expenses, it's more economical than renting.

11
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,960
Yes, of course, property ownership has its advantages.

12
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,340
But it's becoming hellish.

13
00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:10,300
So, my family once owned an estate in Vendée, a small castle in Touraine, another in Burgundy with some vines, a manor house in Brittany, a hunting lodge in Sologne, a farmhouse in Provence, a chalet in the Alps, a nice little almshouse in Périgord and a cottage in Normandy.

14
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,600
But now it has become impossible

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,820
With taxes

16
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,360
And above all, the lack of servants

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,420
Because, let's face it, we're no longer being served.

18
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,420
How right you are, my dear friend!

19
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,060
Would you please pass me the salt?

20
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,640
We don't have any problems with domestic staff.

21
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,540
It must be said that we do not have a large estate

22
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,180
But we still have a small house in the countryside.

23
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,800
which serves as our second home, near Dreux.

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,020
It was a small peasant's house.

25
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,140
which was in very poor condition when we bought it.

26
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,280
The doors wouldn't close, and there were no more panes of glass in the windows.

27
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,840
We did all the repairs ourselves.

28
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,440
Almost all the roof tiles had to be replaced.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,080
Everything had to be repainted, everything had to be reupholstered.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,440
We trained the masons, the mold makers, the carpenters,

31
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,640
plumbers, painters.

32
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,760
The whole family worked.

33
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,560
It took us two years to make it habitable.

34
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,560
We had the water brought in and the electricity installed.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,620
The barn was converted into a garage.

36
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,920
That wasn't the hardest part.

37
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,020
All you had to do was drop an N and add an A.

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,580
Oh, stop. Stop with your absurd wordplay.

39
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,040
What is an absurd pun?

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,500
Grange, garage.

41
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,640
You have barn, the word barn, and you want to make a garage.

42
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,320
You remove an N and add an A. You see?

43
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,760
Non.

44
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,160
Go get your Scrabble, I'll show you.

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,680
Marie-Laure gets up.

46
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,640
Madame Belleau reprimands her.

47
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,040
Marie-Laure, what are you doing? Would you mind sitting down?

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,320
Dad told me.

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,720
Ah good.

50
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:22,800
So, you aggregate, you remove an N, you add an A, and you make a garage.

51
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,560
So.

52
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,000
Is that it?

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,720
It wasn't difficult, was it?

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,420
Meanwhile, Ms. Belleau continues her conversation with Robert.

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,260
This has become very common lately.

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,020
City people are buying old peasant houses,

57
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,620
They modernize them and use them as second homes.

58
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,520
They come here for the weekend.

59
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,380
I find it sad to see farmers being driven out of their old houses.

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,640
But we're not chasing anyone away.

61
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,480
These are old, abandoned houses that are mostly falling into ruin.

62
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,320
In any case, we earned our house.

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,300
We worked really hard on it and it's definitely ours.

64
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,300
At that moment, a doorbell rings.

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,000
I think someone rang the bell.

66
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,260
Marie-Laure, would you please go and see?

67
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,640
Marie-Laure gets up and leaves the room.

68
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,440
Hello, little one.

69
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,580
Would you like some tickets from your handsome friend?

70
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,460
Ah, no, no.

71
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,620
Ah yes, that's what I want.

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,460
Very nicely.

73
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,300
Non !

74
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,820
A moment later, she returns.

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,380
What was it?

76
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,240
A nun.

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,580
What did she want?

78
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,740
She wanted to sell me lottery tickets to win an old 16th-century priory.

79
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,260
What's this all about? And what did you do?

80
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,800
I told him that we weren't interested, that we already had a second home

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,180
and that with the taxes and the lack of domestic staff, that was enough as it was.

82
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,520
Marie-Laure

83
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
What? That's not true?

84
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,060
But you should have called me, come on, that poor nun

85
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,660
Well, it wasn't a real one.

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,880
How so ?

87
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,860
No, she was a fake nun.

88
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,700
How do you know?

89
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,880
She had a mustache

90
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,480
That's not a reason

91
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,640
They must be nuns with moustaches.

92
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,120
Maybe, yes

93
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,660
Aunt Amélie has a moustache

94
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,100
But she had a mustache like that

95
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,660
Bizarre

96
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,540
Bizarre.

97
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,880
Today, the main topic of discussion is the Bélots' apartment.

98
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,700
and their second home.

99
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,200
The Bélots live at 18 rue de Vaugirard, in an apartment.

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,320
They are not tenants.

101
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,080
If you don't have a car, you can rent one.

102
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,240
You remember that Robert rented a car to go to Provins.

103
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,740
When you don't have a house, you can rent a house or an apartment.

104
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,420
You remember that the Bélots rented a holiday home in Brittany.

105
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,140
When you rent a house or an apartment, you are a tenant.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,800
When you are a tenant, you have to pay the rent every month.

107
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,080
You need to send a check to the landlord for the rent.

108
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,580
The Bélots do not pay rent because they are not tenants, they are owners.

109
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:44,580
The apartment belongs to them. They don't pay rent, but they do pay building fees. They pay for the building's heating, for repairs, for the periodic cleaning of the facade, and for the caretakers' salaries. The caretakers are the concierge or concierge.

110
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:54,240
Every month, the owners, or rather the co-owners of the building, have to pay the caretaker, the concierge.

111
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:02,700
According to Mr. Bello, even with these expenses that must be paid, it is more advantageous to be an owner than a tenant.

112
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,660
But overall, even with all the expenses, it's more economical than renting.

113
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,680
Yes, of course, property ownership has its advantages.

114
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,060
But it's becoming hellish.

115
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:38,200
My family once owned an estate in Vendée, a small castle in Touraine, another in Burgundy with some vineyards, a manor house in Brittany, a hunting lodge in Sologne, a farmhouse in Provence, a chalet in the Alps, a charming cottage in Périgord and a cottage in Normandy.

116
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:46,660
Hubert lists a whole bunch of properties and estates that his family supposedly owned all over France.

117
00:08:46,660 --> 00:09:00,280
In Normandy, Brittany, Vendée, Touraine, Burgundy, and Sologne

118
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,800
In Provence

119
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,300
In the Alps

120
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,980
In the Périgord

121
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Obviously, when Hubert lists all his properties, all his beautiful estates, he's having a little fun.

122
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,300
He plays a role, the role of a descendant of a great aristocratic family.

123
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:30,060
Marie-Laure takes him seriously, but he's not entirely serious; he might be exaggerating a little.

124
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:40,400
This small castle in Touraine, for example, is the Château de Chambord, built in the 16th century by King Francis I.

125
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:48,180
It now belongs to the State and has never, to my knowledge, belonged to the Pinot-Chambre family.

126
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:55,140
A manor house, a country house, these are small castles, the home of a gentleman.

127
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,840
The mask is the typical house of Provence.

128
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,880
And the chalet is the typical wooden house of the Alps.

129
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,920
These are chalets in the Alps.

130
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,800
Old peasant chalets.

131
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,940
And modern chalets for second homes.

132
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,920
So, in the past, the Dubert family owned a whole bunch of properties.

133
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,400
But now, that's no longer possible.

134
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,920
Yes, of course, property ownership has its advantages.

135
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,280
But it's becoming hellish.

136
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,860
It is no longer possible to own properties.

137
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,900
It's too difficult. It's horrible, awful.

138
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,140
It's hell. It's becoming infernal.

139
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,540
This has become impossible for two reasons.

140
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,400
First, because of taxes, property taxes.

141
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,900
We need to give money to the state every year.

142
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,180
It's very expensive.

143
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,820
And then, the other reason is the lack of servants.

144
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,540
In the past, people had servants.

145
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,260
We had servants who waited on you.

146
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,600
Today, there are no more servants to serve you.

147
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,480
We are no longer being served.

148
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,160
Courteous people have a good servant, yes, but it's rare.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,100
And besides, today's maids don't work like they used to.

150
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,720
Because, let's face it, we're no longer being served.

151
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,300
Here, look.

152
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,040
Aline ! Aline ! Aline !

153
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,580
It's incredible how badly they can serve you.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,900
Excuse me, madam.

155
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,040
The Belleaus, however, have no servants at all. They don't have a maid.

156
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,420
Fortunately, they have Marie-Laure.

157
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,400
Marie-Laure, please go and get some bread.

158
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,080
Yes.

159
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,160
I think someone rang the doorbell. Marie-Laure, would you please go and see?

160
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,940
Hey, would you mind passing the book over there?

161
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,120
THANKS.

162
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,200
Are you going to get me a pencil?

163
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,500
Oh dear, hey, I'm not your maid, am I?

164
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
If you want a pencil, you go get it yourself.

165
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,020
Oh dear, it has to be said, we're no longer being served.

166
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,360
Hey, no, we're not being served anymore.

167
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,480
You have to do everything yourself.

168
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,000
When you only have a small apartment, like Aunt Georgette,

169
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,160
It's still okay, we can manage.

170
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,340
But when you have a rather large house,

171
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,660
When you have multiple properties, this is no longer possible.

172
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,760
We can't do it.

173
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,400
We don't have any problems with domestic staff.

174
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,300
It must be said that we do not have a large estate.

175
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,940
But we still have a small house in the countryside.

176
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,660
which serves as our second home.

177
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,580
The Bélots have this apartment in Paris. It is their main residence.

178
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,460
And then, they also have a small house in the countryside.

179
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,700
That's their second home.

180
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,280
They use it as a second home for holidays and weekends.

181
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,720
It was a small peasant's house that was in very poor condition that we bought.

182
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,860
Peasants.

183
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,060
A peasant's house in Vendée.

184
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,440
A peasant's house in the Pyrenees.

185
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,560
A peasant's house in Burgundy.

186
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,760
A house in poor condition.

187
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,400
Another house in poor condition.

188
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,980
A house in very poor condition.

189
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,260
A house in very, very bad condition, in ruins.

190
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,380
And there you have it, a ruined castle.

191
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,100
And here's a car in very bad condition.

192
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,840
When the Bélots bought this house, it was in very bad condition.

193
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,160
The doors wouldn't close.

194
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,180
Doors are made to close, aren't they?

195
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,940
I close the door.

196
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,860
That's a door that closes properly.

197
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,660
But the doors of the Bélots' house did not close, or closed poorly.

198
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,440
They needed to be repaired.

199
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,560
There were no panes of glass in the windows.

200
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,080
Normally, there are panes of glass in the windows.

201
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,560
There are windows here.

202
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,220
You can see the reflection in the windows.

203
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,840
But in the Bélots' house, there were no panes of glass in the windows, or they were broken.

204
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,840
They had to be replaced.

205
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,840
The roof tiles also had to be replaced.

206
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Many tiles were broken. They had to be replaced.

207
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Everything had to be repainted.

208
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
These are some painters.

209
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:49,780
The walls needed to be wallpapered again and again.

210
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,220
The Bélots did everything themselves.

211
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,380
They repainted it themselves.

212
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,920
They became painters.

213
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,380
That gentleman is a painter.

214
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,980
He's a painter, a real painter.

215
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,700
But is Mr. Bélot a painter?

216
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,300
No, he is not a painter.

217
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,700
He is an engineer at Renault.

218
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,480
But he's a painter.

219
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:31,440
He's not a bricklayer, but he does the bricklaying. He does all kinds of trades. Bicycles created painters, bricklayers, and carpenters. There's a carpenter. And there are the joiners. Carpenters build the frameworks.

220
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,760
Bicycles made the plumbers

221
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,520
A plumber

222
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,440
Bicycles are not carpenters or plumbers.

223
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,400
But they did the plumbing.

224
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,560
Look at Marie-Laure there

225
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,900
She's playing airplane

226
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,740
Is Marie-Laure an airplane?

227
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,860
No, but she's doing the airplane thing.

228
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,980
Be quiet for a bit, there's no way to work

229
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,000
Stop acting like an idiot

230
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,480
I'm not acting like an idiot, I'm acting like an airplane

231
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,700
The locals had the water brought in and they had the electricity installed.

232
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,960
They had the water turned on.

233
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,800
There was no water in that house, so the people had water brought in.

234
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,900
They didn't do it themselves.

235
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,140
They called in workers, specialists who brought in the water.

236
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:29,300
The locals had the water brought in, the workers brought the water.

237
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:38,600
There was no electricity either, so the locals had electricity installed.

238
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,240
They didn't install the electricity themselves; it's too dangerous.

239
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,580
They brought in specialists, electricians.

240
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,040
They worked hard to make the house habitable.

241
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,760
When they bought it, it was not habitable, it was uninhabitable.

242
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,820
Now it is habitable.

243
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,720
They made it habitable.

244
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,140
It was a lot of work.

245
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,480
It took them two years to make it habitable.

246
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,880
It took them two years.

247
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,580
It took them two years.

248
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,360
It took them two years.

249
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,080
It took us two years to make it habitable.

250
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,900
We had the water brought in and the electricity installed.

251
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,680
The barn was converted into a garage.

252
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,760
There was a barn, because it was a peasant's house.

253
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,420
A barn for storing hay.

254
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,060
The Bélots didn't need a barn, but they did need a garage for their car.

255
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,240
So, they converted the barn into a garage.

256
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,000
Easy, said Mireille.

257
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,440
That wasn't the hardest part. All you had to do was drop Anne and add an A.

258
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,620
Look.

259
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,400
You have barn, the word barn, and you want to make a garage.

260
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,560
You remove an N and add an A. You see?

261
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:01,820
Non.

262
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,940
Marie-Laure can't see. She doesn't understand.

263
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:20,120
You agranges, you remove an N, you add an A, you agarrages. There you go.

264
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,960
You remove an N. You remove. It's the verb to remove.

265
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,580
Look, I put on my glasses, I take off my glasses.

266
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,160
Look, he's taking off his glasses.

267
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,100
He takes off his cap.

268
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,260
She takes off her sweater.

269
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,520
There is redness on the cheek.

270
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,280
Wait, I'll take it off for you.

271
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,300
Yes, wait.

272
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:56,880
Okay, so the Bélots live in Paris, on rue de Vaugirard, in an apartment.

273
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,620
They are the owners.

274
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,520
This is their main residence.

275
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,360
They also have a house in the countryside.

276
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
They own this house too.

277
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,240
It belongs to them. They bought it.

278
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,780
This house in the countryside serves as their holiday home.

279
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,180
This has become very common lately.

280
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,940
City people are buying old peasant houses,

281
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,520
They modernize them and use them as second homes.

282
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
They come here for the weekend.

283
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,080
Robert, imagine poor peasants being driven from their homes by city people.

284
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,200
But Mireille reassures him.

285
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,960
But we're not chasing anyone away.

286
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
But him, yes, we'll chase him away.

287
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,000
But we don't drive out the peasants.

288
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,340
These are old, abandoned houses that are mostly falling into ruin.

289
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:51,460
Okay, let's see, we'll ask this lady where she lives and if she has a second home.

290
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,340
Which neighborhood do you live in?

291
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,260
I live in the fifth arrondissement, not far from this garden.

292
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,800
Do you live in a villa?

293
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,540
I live in a building, in an apartment.

294
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,820
Are you a homeowner?

295
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,640
No, I am renting the apartment.

296
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:36,420
Which neighborhood do you live in? In the 4th arrondissement, near, in the Marais. Do you own your home? Yes. Is it a house? It's an apartment. So you're a co-owner? Yes, exactly. Are the maintenance fees high?

297
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,200
Yes, quite a lot, because there is construction work.

298
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,860
Which neighborhood do you live in?

299
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,260
In the 15th arrondissement.

300
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,140
Are you a homeowner?

301
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,560
Yes.

302
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,160
Is the rent expensive?

303
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,180
I don't pay rent because I own my home.

304
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
So you pay taxes?

305
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,240
Yes.

306
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,260
Are you in a condominium?

307
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,780
Yes.

308
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,720
What do the charges include?

309
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,640
The concierge's salary, garbage collection, and maintenance work.

310
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,340
And do you own a second home?

311
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:15,540
Non.

312
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,620
Where are you going on vacation?

313
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,240
In the south of France, near Aix-en-Provence.

314
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,920
Since you don't have a second home, how do you manage?

315
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,360
I rent a house.

316
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,640
While the Bélots are talking about their second home, there's a knock at the door.

317
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
Marie-Laure will open.

318
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,500
What was it?

319
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,380
A nun.

320
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,920
A nun.

321
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,420
A nun.

322
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,140
What did she want?

323
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,340
She wanted to sell me lottery tickets to win an old 16th-century priory.

324
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,940
A priority.

325
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,940
Did Marie-Laure buy lottery tickets?

326
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,080
Non.

327
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,500
She said she wasn't interested.

328
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,640
I told him that we weren't interested.

329
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,780
Marie-Laure doesn't want to win an old 16th-century prayer book.

330
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,980
He's not interested.

331
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,580
She already has a second home.

332
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,800
A second home is enough.

333
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,520
With taxes, the lack of domestic staff, all that.

334
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,320
What's this all about? And what did you do?

335
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
I told him that we weren't interested.

336
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
That we already had a second home.

337
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,240
And that with the taxes and the lack of domestic staff, that was enough as it was.

338
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,320
Marie-Laure!

339
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,520
What? That's not true?

340
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,460
But you should have called me, come on, the poor nun.

341
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,440
Well, it wasn't a real one.

342
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,120
How so ?

343
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
No, she was a fake nun.

344
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,880
How do you know?

345
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,140
She had a mustache.

346
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,180
She wasn't a real nun.

347
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,420
Now that, yes, is a real good nun.

348
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,200
But no, that's not a real nun.

349
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,120
Do you see the mustache?

350
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,260
Okay, now listen carefully to the dialogue between Marie-Laure and her mother about the nun.

351
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,060
Next, you will answer Mrs. Belleau as if you were Marie-Laure.

352
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,460
But you should have called me, come on, the poor nun.

353
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,420
Well, it wasn't a real one.

354
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,040
How so ?

355
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,020
No, she was a fake nun.

356
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,760
How do you know?

357
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,040
She had a mustache.

358
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,420
Now, answer as if you were Marie-Laure.

359
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,880
But you should have called me, come on, the poor nun.

360
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,140
Well, it wasn't a real one.

361
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,680
Well, it wasn't a real one.

362
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,920
Well, it wasn't a real one.

363
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,500
How so ?

364
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,480
No, she was a fake nun.

365
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,880
No, she was a fake nun.

366
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,240
No, she was a fake nun.

367
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,060
And how do you know that?

368
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,320
She had a mustache.

369
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,340
She had a mustache.

370
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,620
She had a mustache.

371
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,080
Now let's see what you have retained.

372
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,640
Listen, watch, think, and speak.

373
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,920
The Belleaux have a very nice apartment on rue de Vaugirard, but they don't pay rent.

374
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,260
Why don't they pay rent?

375
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,400
Because they own the property.

376
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,260
The caretaker, who is she? Do you know who she is?

377
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,560
She's the concierge.

378
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,260
In your opinion, is this a chalet in the Alps or a house in Provence?

379
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,800
A chalet in the Alps.

380
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,920
Is that a Norman cottage or a Provençal mass?

381
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,000
It's more of a Provençal mass.

382
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,800
In your opinion, is Mr. Bello working as a bricklayer or a carpenter here?

383
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,740
He's a bricklayer.

384
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,800
And here, is he playing the painter or the plumber?

385
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,740
The painter.

386
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,800
Look closely. Are the Bellos having water brought in or electricity installed?

387
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,700
They are having the water brought in.

388
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,700
And is that a barn or a garage?

389
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,100
A barn.

390
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,120
Warning, this is going to be very difficult.

391
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,700
To convert a barn into a garage, do you need to add an N or remove an N?

392
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,620
We need to remove an N.

393
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,880
Look at this house.

394
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,700
In summary, is it habitable or is it in poor condition?

395
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,300
It's in bad condition. It's in very bad condition.

396
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,560
Everything needs to be repaired. Everything needs to be done.

397
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,660
Mr. Guignol, it's cold.

398
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Would you like to turn on the heating, please?

399
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,400
Mr. Guignol, the windows are dirty.

400
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,560
You can't even see the Moparnasse tower anymore.

401
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,120
Would you please wash the windows, Mr. Guignol?

402
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,120
Mr. Guignol, the living room walls are dirty.

403
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,900
Would you like to repaint them, please?

404
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,960
In pink, please, Mr. Guignol.

405
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,000
Mr. Guignol, it's raining in my room.

406
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,580
The roof tiles will need to be replaced, please.

407
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:28,280
Oh dear, this is becoming hellish.

408
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,300
We're not even being served anymore

409
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,260
Hey, Mr. Guignol, wake up!

410
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,220
Oh, hey, gently, gently

411
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,280
You can see that I'm asleep, can't you?
