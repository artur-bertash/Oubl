and fly away. Very soon, you will see what happens and you will be able to say a few things.

3
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:45,260
things in French yourself. Robert and Mireille talk about surnames, like Taylor, which are

4
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,280
They also include names of trades and professions. They compare notes on their childhood ambitions,

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,960
remembering their dreams of being a fireman, a traveler, a nurse, an actress.

Paris, in the spring.

8
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,740
There are flowers in the Luxembourg Garden.

9
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,820
A little girl is playing gently with her boat.

10
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,940
It is 10 a.m.

11
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,380
In the Senate, the senators are debating.

12
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:06,140
In the garden, on a bench, two young people are talking.

13
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,440
Who are these young people?

14
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,120
Ah, but it's Mireille, Mireille Bello and Robert Taylor.

15
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,160
Your name is Taylor? But that means tailor in English.

16
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,500
Uh, I don't know.

17
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,720
Yes, Taylor means tailor in English.

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,620
But everyone knows that, My Taylor is rich, it's in all the English books.

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:40,880
Yes, no, of course not. But I mean, my name is spelled with a Y, and the English word for tailor is spelled with an I.

20
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,140
But that doesn't matter. It's probably the same thing. Spelling, you know, doesn't mean anything.

21
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,800
In fact, there are lots of people whose names are professions. Take Boucher, for example. It's a proper noun, a family name.

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:01,540
There are lots of people named Boucher, like Boucher the 18th-century painter, or Hélène Boucher for example, she was an aviator.

23
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,740
And Boucher, of course, is also a job title, the butcher who sells meat.

24
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:13,400
That's how I remember once seeing Mr. Boucher, pharmacist, on a pharmacy.

25
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,660
He was a gentleman who was a pharmacist by trade, but his name was Boucher.

26
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:26,400
And have you ever seen on a butcher's shop, Mr. Pharmacist Butcher, a pharmacist's name is a

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,800
It's a job title or occupational name, but it's not a proper noun; nobody calls themselves a pharmacist.

28
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,640
As far as I know, I'm not a computer scientist, but there are plenty of people named baker, like

29
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,980
the one who makes bread or carpenter like the one who makes the frames Gustave carpenter by

30
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,840
For example, he was a composer. Messenger, too, is a job title. The one who

31
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,100
It carries messages or goods. It is also a proper noun. André Messager is

32
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:05,620
A composer. A charcoal burner, someone who sells charcoal. It is also a proper noun.

33
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,340
And also forester, tailor, cattle herder. Cattle herder? That's my mother's maiden name.

34
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,300
But it's not a job title

35
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,480
Yes, of course it's a job title

36
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,760
Finally, it was a job title, in the past.

37
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,820
The herdsman was the one who drove the oxen.

38
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,740
Obviously, this isn't done much in France anymore.

39
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Profession or cattle herder, that's not something people say much anymore.

40
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,220
We usually talk about a tractor driver.

41
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,100
Chevrier is also a family name

42
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,280
The goatherd is the one who takes care of the goats.

43
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,100
And then there's also the shepherd, like the one who takes care of the sheep.

44
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,380
And then miners, sailors.

45
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,520
Sailors, that's what I wanted to be when I was 12 or 13 years old.

46
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,240
Yes, it's funny the ideas we have when we're little.

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,100
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was little?

48
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,140
I wanted to be a nurse and an actress.

49
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,700
Nurse by day and actress by night.

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,900
I also had some rather strange ideas.

51
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,480
When I was little, when I was 7 or 8 years old, I wanted to be a firefighter.

52
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,620
to drive at full speed through the streets and make a lot of noise.

53
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
Climb to the top of the tall ladder

54
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,720
and dive into an open window that is spewing flames and smoke.

55
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,200
And to save the babies asleep amidst the flames.

56
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,360
Mireille !

57
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,080
Where did you come from like that?

58
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,820
From the basin.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
Did you go diving in the pool?

60
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,240
No, not really.

61
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,920
I fell, I tried to grab my boat,

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,960
So I leaned over, then I slipped, then I fell, that's it.

63
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,000
Ah, that's clever.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,080
Go get changed, come on, go home right away

65
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,700
And you had a sore throat, what will Mom say?

66
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,800
That girl is unbearable, luckily she knows how to swim

67
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,360
She will surely become a swimming champion

68
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,260
Or she might go on underwater exploration with Cousteau's team

69
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,820
You never know

70
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,860
No, you never know how things will turn out.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:38,980
Subtitling by Radio-Canada

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,800
The seamstresses.

73
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,320
Observe.

74
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,080
Dad, if you wanted, you could be a seamstress?

75
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,520
Tailor, if you don't mind.

76
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,400
Yeah, a tailor, basically.

77
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
Being a painter is also a profession.

78
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,000
He's someone who makes paintings.

79
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,760
Courbet, for example, was a painter.

80
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,320
The baker is the one who makes the bread.

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,620
And his wife, who helps him make the bread or who sells the bread, is the baker.

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,780
The carpenter is the one who makes the frameworks.

83
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,340
The butcher is the one who sells meat.

84
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,840
Beef, veal, mutton

85
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,140
A charcoal seller is someone who sells charcoal

86
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,240
A pharmacist is someone who sells medicines

87
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,380
A computer scientist is someone who works with a computer.

88
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,040
A nurse is someone who works in a hospital.

89
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:44,040
A sailor is someone who works on a ship, and a miner is someone who

90
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,380
A composer works in a mine to extract coal; a composer is someone who composes music.

91
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:59,720
In music, an actor is someone who performs in theater or film; an aviator is...

92
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,480
It's someone who pilots an airplane.

93
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,820
A tractor driver,

94
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,060
It's someone who drives a tractor.

95
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,100
A driver is someone who drives a car.

96
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,380
A taxi driver, for example.

97
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,900
And a cattle herder was someone who used to drive oxen.

98
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,580
But nowadays, that's not done much anymore.

99
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:41,080
And then there are also the shepherds who take care of the sheep, the goatherds who take care of the goats, the foresters who take care of the forests.

100
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,260
Now, we are going to ask this gentleman if he knows any people who have job titles.

101
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,740
Do you know anyone named Boucher?

102
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,520
The painter.

103
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,140
Do you know anyone named Charpentier?

104
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,860
The musician

105
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,740
Now you are going to talk

106
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,660
Listen to this short dialogue between Robert and Mireille

107
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,040
And you're going to repeat what Mireille says.

108
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,560
Being a sailor is what I wanted to be when I was 12 or 13 years old.

109
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,940
Yes, it's funny the ideas we have when we're little

110
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,120
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was little?

111
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,160
I wanted to be a nurse and an actress

112
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,240
Now it's your turn.

113
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,600
Yes, it's funny the ideas we have when we're little.

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,360
Yes, it's funny the ideas we have when we're little.

115
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,060
Yes, it's funny the ideas we have when we're little.

116
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,060
You know what I wanted to be when I was little.

117
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,860
You know what I wanted to be when I was little.

118
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
You know what I wanted to be when I was little.

119
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,320
I wanted to be a nurse and an actress

120
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,380
I wanted to be a nurse and an actress

121
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:06,540
I wanted to be a nurse and an actress

122
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,060
Forester, shepherd, cattle herder – these are job titles.

123
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,860
But they are also proper names, family names

124
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,560
There are people named forester, or Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd, or Miss Cowherd.

125
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,740
In fact, there are lots of people who have a job title.

126
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:44,540
Lots of people, many people. A lot of people, lots and lots. Look. One person, lots of people. One orange, lots of oranges. Fruit, lots of fruit. Peaches, lots of peaches. One cherry, lots of cherries. People, lots and lots of people.

127
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,340
There are lots of people, lots of men, lots of women

128
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,840
And then there are plenty of women.

129
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,660
Isn't that right, Antoine?

130
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,220
There are lots of people named Boucher

131
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,040
Like the 18th century painter

132
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,400
Or Hélène Boucher, the viatrician

133
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,840
Or like this pharmacist, observed

134
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,620
A pharmacist, a female pharmacist

135
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:37,620
a computer scientist, a technician, a pharmacist, a baker, a shepherd, a shepherdess, a farmer, a farmer

136
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:51,840
A male nurse. An actor, an actress. A male pilot, a female pilot.

137
00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:07,480
Aviator, aviatrix, that's not how we say it anymore. It used to be said, around 1930. But now, it's not said anymore. It used to be said, but it's not said today.

138
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,820
That was said, but it's in the past.

139
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,300
That's no longer how it's said, it's the present tense.

140
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,900
That used to be said, but it's not said anymore.

141
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,860
It's over, finished.

142
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,200
That's what people said, that's what was said.

143
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,640
In the past, we used to talk about aviators.

144
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,920
Now, we no longer say aviator.

145
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,660
Today, we're talking about pilots.

146
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,400
In the past, we used to talk about messengers.

147
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
A messenger was someone who carried messages.

148
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,080
Mercury, for example, was the messenger of the gods.

149
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,120
Today, we no longer speak of messenger as a profession.

150
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,360
But there are still messages.

151
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,780
Look, for example, at Marie-Laure taking a message.

152
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,780
In the past, the herdsman was the one who drove the oxen.

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,660
Today, we drive tractors.

154
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:08,020
When Mireille was little, she wanted to be a nurse and an actress

155
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,360
She was, that's the past

156
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,240
She is, that is the present

157
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,060
She wanted to, that's in the past

158
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,520
She wants, present

159
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,100
Now, Mireille is grown up

160
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,900
She no longer wants to be a nurse or an actress.

161
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,000
When she was little, Mireille had a doll.

162
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,840
Now she has a little sister.

163
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,920
She had, she has.

164
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,360
Now, let's see if you've understood.

165
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,640
That's what people used to say.

166
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,200
That's in the past.

167
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Today, we don't say that anymore.

168
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
This is the present.

169
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,080
Okay, your turn.

170
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:13,660
"In the past, people drove oxen. That's history. Today, we drive trucks, tractors, cars. That's the present."

171
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:26,680
"Mireille wanted to be a nurse and Robert, a firefighter. That's the past. Robert wants to go to the Basque Country. Present."

172
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,180
His mother often talked about it.

173
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,080
Fits.

174
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,340
He spent his holidays in Bermuda.

175
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,360
Fits.

176
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,740
He spent a year in France.

177
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,320
Here.

178
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,580
The weather is nice.

179
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,160
Here.

180
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,020
The weather was nice.

181
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,660
Fits.

182
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Robert was a student in the United States.

183
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,900
Fits.

184
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,500
Mireille is a student

185
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,140
Here

186
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,760
Watch out!

187
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,520
Robert was a student

188
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,020
Pass

189
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,420
Mireille is a student

190
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,660
Here

191
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,300
She is leaving the institute

192
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,420
Here

193
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,060
Do you know how to spell "sort"?

194
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,500
It's spelled SORT

195
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,280
It's spelled with a T.

196
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,380
It's pronounced SORT, but it's spelled SORT.

197
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,360
It's a matter of spelling.

198
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,980
Spelling, you know, doesn't mean anything.

199
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,880
Oh, well, all the same, yes, spelling is important.

200
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,880
You need to know how to write, right?

201
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,980
What do you think?

202
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,180
But yes, look, Mrs. Belleau, she thinks that spelling is important.

203
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,800
She thinks that you need to know how to write, that you need to do dictations, spelling exercises.

204
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,080
You need to know how things are written.

205
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,220
Go ahead, write "spelling".

206
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,620
Spelling?

207
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,400
Yes, spelling.

208
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,580
It's a spelling exercise, a dictation.

209
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,540
How do you spell "orthographe"?

210
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,980
Orthography, with TH and PH.

211
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,060
It's simple.

212
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,580
So, you write?

213
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,420
Yes, yes, I am writing.

214
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,500
I am writing.

215
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,560
You write.

216
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,680
We write.

217
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,680
We write.

218
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,720
You write.

219
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,580
They write.

220
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:59,140
Spelling is interesting. Look, see. We write: Third person singular present tense. We write:

221
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:12,820
It's spelled with a T. Well, there are many verbs that are spelled with a T in the third person singular of the present tense. We don't pronounce the T, but it's spelled with a T.

222
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:42,800
For example,

223
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:50,940
There are others that are written with a D, but the D is not pronounced.

224
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,820
But there are verbs that are written with an E.

225
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:06,680
She arrives, she listens, she speaks, she begins, she continues, she tries, she gets bored.

226
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,520
And then, there are verbs that are written with an A.

227
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,060
She goes, she has.

228
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:24,200
The third person plural usually ends with ENT, which is written but not pronounced.

229
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,960
They arrive, they continue, they try, they choose, they learn, they come, they persevere.

230
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,820
And there are some verbs that end in ON, ONT.

231
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,380
They have, they go, they do.

232
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,960
And what are Robert and Mireille doing?

233
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,720
Ah, hey, Robert and Mireille, I'd forgotten about them.

234
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,680
Well, Robert and Mireille are on their bench in the Luxembourg Gardens.

235
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,400
And they talk, they talk about what they wanted to do when they were little

236
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,720
It's funny the ideas we have when we're little

237
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,840
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was little?

238
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,860
I wanted to be a nurse and an actress

239
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,760
So, nurse by day and actress by night

240
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,120
Yes, being a nurse during the day and an actress at night is a bizarre idea, a strange idea.

241
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,700
It's funny, it's amusing, isn't it?

242
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,520
Look, that's funny too, that's amusing, isn't it?

243
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,680
Don't you find that funny?

244
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,860
And you don't find that funny?

245
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,960
I find it funny.

246
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,900
Robert also had some strange ideas.

247
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,180
He wanted to be a firefighter.

248
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
It's good to be a firefighter.

249
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,360
That has advantages, because if you're not a firefighter, you can't drive very fast in the city.

250
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,960
Speed ​​is limited.

251
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,100
You cannot go faster than 60 km/h.

252
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,660
But if you're a firefighter, you can drive at full speed.

253
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,360
Here is a man driving at full speed.

254
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,540
In fact, he's going too fast.

255
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,380
You're going too fast.

256
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,000
I like speed.

257
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,680
If you're not a firefighter, you can't make any noise.

258
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,040
You cannot honk your horn

259
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,020
Come on, come on, come quickly, and without making a sound

260
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:22,660
But if you're a firefighter, you can make all the noise you want.

261
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,480
If you're not a firefighter, you can climb onto a chair

262
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,620
You can climb onto the table

263
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,420
or you can climb a small ladder.

264
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,660
But the firefighters, they have tall ladders.

265
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,260
And if you are a firefighter, you can climb to the top of the tall ladder.

266
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,160
It's more interesting, it's more exciting.

267
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,740
If you're not a firefighter, you can dive into a swimming pool with water.

268
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,520
Or you can dive into a pool without water.

269
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,920
Or you can dive into the sea.

270
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,340
But if you're a firefighter, you can dive through a window

271
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,500
that breathes flames and smoke and saves sleeping babies.

272
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,240
Or to save the little girls who fell into the Luxembourg basin.

273
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,340
Mireille !

274
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,060
Where did you come from like that?

275
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,780
From the basin.

276
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
Did you go diving in the pool?

277
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,140
No, not really. I wanted to grab my boat and then I slipped.

278
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,900
I fell, and that's that.

279
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,840
Marie-Laure fell into the pool.

280
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,820
Here, Robert falls from a balcony.

281
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,040
Here, he falls off his horse.

282
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,780
Here, the apple falls on Newton's head.

283
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,160
And this gentleman has teeth that are falling out.

284
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
Look at this young man, he's going to fall.

285
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,460
Marie-Laure fell because she leaned over.

286
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
Jean-Claude, do you want to lean over?

287
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:12,560
It's dangerous to lean over. You could fall.

288
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,400
Look at this man. He's leaning over, he's leaning over, he's going to fall.

289
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,440
There he goes, he falls. He has fallen.

290
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,760
Marie-Laure bent down to grab her boat.

291
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,640
Here, she catches Fido.

292
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,680
Here, she caught a snake.

293
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,980
She leaned over and slipped.

294
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,220
He slipped too.

295
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,100
He slipped too.

296
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,880
Look at this dancer.

297
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,700
He's going to slip and fall.

298
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,640
Jean-Claude, do you want to slide?

299
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,200
She leaned over, she slipped and whoosh, she fell into the pool.

300
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,860
Luckily she went swimming.

301
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,240
Luckily she knows how to swim

302
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,260
Here's a young girl who knows how to swim

303
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,560
He doesn't know how to swim

304
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,000
It's good to know how to swim

305
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,960
Marie-Laure is a very good swimmer

306
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,720
She will become a swimming champion

307
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,900
Okay, she's going to do some underwater exploration.

308
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,440
Meanwhile, she's completely soaked.

309
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,820
She's soaked

310
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,100
She's going to catch a cold.

311
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,020
She should go change

312
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,780
Go on, get changed, go home right away

313
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,420
Here is a young woman who is going to change her clothes.

314
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,500
There, she's changed.

315
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,320
Marie-Laure is going to change her clothes.

316
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,560
There, she's changed.

317
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,680
She doesn't look like a swimming champion, but that doesn't mean anything.

318
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,860
She might become a swimming champion.

319
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,400
You never know. You never know how things will turn out.

320
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,440
No, you never know how things will turn out.

321
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,480
So, let's see what you know.

322
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,300
If you want to buy bread, you go to the baker.

323
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,520
But if you want to buy meat, you go to the butcher.

324
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,820
If you want to buy medicine, you go to the pharmacist.

325
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,400
If you are sick in the hospital, who takes care of you?

326
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,980
A nurse.

327
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,760
And if you are a sheep, who takes care of you?

328
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:33,020
A shepherd, what made this painting? A composer? A baker?

329
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:40,100
pharmacist, a painter, an 18th-century painter whose name was butcher

330
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,080
Besides, you know there are tons of people who have job titles like

331
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,800
job titles like butcher, for example, and aviators (male and female) were used.

332
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,700
That was the case in the past, around 1930, but today it's no longer said.

333
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,480
We're talking about a pilot, not a pilot.

334
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,980
And there, there, is an orange.

335
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,120
And there, there's a pile of oranges.

336
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,120
Look at Robert and Mireille on their bench.

337
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
They're grown up now.

338
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,420
She is 18 or 19 years old and he is 20 or 21 years old.

339
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,280
They are talking. What are they talking about?

340
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,540
They talk about what they wanted to do when they were little.

341
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:34,540
When she was little, Mireille wanted to be a nurse and an actress.

342
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,000
And Robert wanted to be a firefighter.

343
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,800
Is Robert a firefighter now? No.

344
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,280
Do you think Mireille will become a nurse?

345
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,620
We don't know.

346
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:55,000
She's studying art history, but you never know how things will turn out.

347
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,100
No, you never know how things will turn out.

348
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,980
Here, take the meeting of Mireille and Robert.

349
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,460
This could go wrong.

350
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,680
Or it could turn out well.

351
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh dear! That's not done anymore!

352
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,040
That's no longer done!

353
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,320
I think this is going to end badly.

354
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,360
Idiot!

355
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,160
Idiot!

356
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,760
Idiot!

357
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,620
Idiot!

358
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,280
Idiot!

359
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,700
Idiot!

360
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,020
Idiot!

361
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,260
Ha! What did I tell you!

362
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,080
I knew it was going to end badly.

363
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,420
Okay, goodbye!

364
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,660
Until next time!

365
00:26:48,620 --> 00:27:17,620
...

366
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:47,600
French subtitles?

367
00:27:47,620 --> 00:28:17,600
French subtitles?

368
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:47,600
