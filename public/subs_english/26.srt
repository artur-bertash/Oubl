00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You have to look and fly away.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And you will be able to say a few words in French yourself.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In a nice restaurant, Robert sees a young couple at a table.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
She is blonde and Robert thinks she might be Mireille, but he can't say for sure.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The chef named several kitchens after a former girlfriend of his.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Another Mireille, who suffered from indigestion.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Touching.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,380
It's Sunday. Robert has nothing to do.

11
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,660
He is taking a walk.

12
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,440
There are people who go to church

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,640
my temple friends.

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:31,740
And everyone buys cakes from the pastry shops.

15
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,780
Robert stops in front of a pastry shop, admires the window display and decides to go in.

16
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,420
Hello Mrs.

17
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,780
Sir, what would you like?

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,420
What is this?

19
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,200
Cream-filled owls.

20
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,100
And this?

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,640
Coffee or chocolate éclairs?

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,540
And this?

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,600
Lemon tarts, sir.

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,140
Nuns, also with coffee or chocolate?

25
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,560
I'll have a nun.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
Yes. With coffee, with chocolate?

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,040
At the café.

28
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,920
Is this for takeout?

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,400
No, it's to eat right away.

30
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,500
There you go, sir, that will be 10 francs.

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,760
Thank you. Goodbye, sir.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,000
Robert continued his walk.

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,140
He enters a restaurant.

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,280
Hello Sir.

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,300
A place setting, please.

36
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,420
This way, please.

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,200
Please.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:57,860
THANKS.

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,600
You are welcome.

40
00:02:59,540 --> 00:02:59,920
Wine.

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,800
Thank you, sir.

42
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,500
Please, sir.

43
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,240
Robert consults the menu.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,060
The martini is for the lady, and the Pernaut is for the gentleman.

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,160
When he looks up, he sees at a neighboring table

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,060
A young blonde woman having lunch with a young man

47
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,620
Robert wonders if it might be Mireille

48
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,040
Please bring us the wine list.

49
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,320
Yes, sir, right away

50
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,700
So, darling, what are you tempted by?

51
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,880
Well, I don't know.

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,400
Something light, I'm not very hungry

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,360
What is their daily special?

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,140
Toulouse cassoulet must be good.

55
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,900
Oh dear, no, that's too heavy.

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,140
What do you want to learn?

57
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,920
Sauerkraut with garnish tempts me, but I don't digest it very well.

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,240
Oh really? Dad says sauerkraut is very easy to digest.

59
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,580
Sauerkraut, perhaps, but goose fat, smoked bacon,

60
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,740
Sausages and ham are a different story.

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
No, but look at the ducks they have.

62
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,760
So, duck with olives, duck with orange,

63
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,340
Duck breast with cherries, duck breast.

64
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,200
without mentioning duck foie gras in the hors d'oeuvres.

65
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,820
Well, we really need to make a decision.

66
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,300
So, what are you having?

67
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,180
Well, I don't know.

68
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,140
I think I'll just have a small herb omelet.

69
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,840
I know you.

70
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,900
You're going to eat an omelet and in two hours you'll die of hunger.

71
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,340
That's how it was last year, when you were on your diet.

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,020
Hey, did you see? Mireille-style eggs.

73
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,620
Where?

74
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,820
There, in the hors d'oeuvres.

75
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
Have you made your choice?

76
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,500
What are Mireille's eggs?

77
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,780
These are stuffed hard-boiled eggs.

78
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,060
The egg yolks are mixed with a tuna and tomato puree

79
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,880
Topped with an anchovy fillet, a black olive, and capers

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,040
Oh, anchovies are too salty.

81
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,620
Oh, there's also a stir-fried chicken, Mireille!

82
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,480
And Mireille, apricots in the desserts.

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,580
Why do you have all these dishes called Mireille?

84
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,640
Ah, sir, that's quite a story.

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,660
A very sad story

86
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,300
Our boss had a girlfriend in his youth named Mireille.

87
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,340
and who died from indigestion caused by pink shrimp.

88
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,100
He is inconsolable and dedicates all his most brilliant culinary creations to her memory.

89
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,900
It's very touching.

90
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,980
And how is this chicken, Mireille?

91
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,720
Sautéed with eggplant and tomatoes.

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
The chicken pieces are sautéed in very hot oil,

93
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,640
Then garnish with slices of fried eggplant and sautéed tomatoes.

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,700
Well, I think I'll have a small grilled steak, a ribeye.

95
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,160
And for me, it will be a pepper steak.

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,680
And what about cooking methods for grilling?

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
For me, medium-rare, please.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,560
And for me, blue

99
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,400
And where to begin?

100
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,980
For me, a plate of raw salmon

101
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,640
You don't have a snail?

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Oh no, sir, I'm sorry

103
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,660
Damage

104
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:25,700
Well, I'll take a dozen oysters and you'll bring us a bottle of Muscadet and half a Moulin à Vent and half a bottle of Badoit mineral water.

105
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,220
THANKS.

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:47,260
The salmon is for the lady, and the oysters are good, thank you.

107
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:05,400
There you go, enjoy your meal.

108
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,360
No, come on, Robert, it's not Mireille.

109
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,260
In fact, she speaks through her nose as if she had a cold.

110
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,000
Enjoy your food.

111
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,620
THANKS.

112
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,880
Mireille doesn't talk like that.

113
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,500
Enjoy your food.

114
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,360
The ribeye steak, madam.

115
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,980
Pepper steak.

116
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,540
THANKS.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,900
Is your ribeye steak okay? Is it cooked to your liking?

118
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,980
Yes, very good. And you? Is your steak blue?

119
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,960
Ah yes. For once, it's really blue.

120
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,520
You take some cheese.

121
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,500
What's wrong?

122
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:02,300
Camembert, Roquefort, Pont-l'Evêque, Cantal, Saint-André, Brie, Chavignol.

123
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,920
That's a goat too.

124
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,460
Okay then, I'll have some Brie.

125
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,060
And for the gentleman.

126
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,520
THANKS.

127
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,000
And for me, a little goat, please.

128
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,560
That one, yes.

129
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,000
Would you like a dessert?

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh no, no dessert for me. I'm not hungry anymore.

131
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,160
Let's see what you have.

132
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,320
Bavarian cream, raspberry tart,

133
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,140
floating islands,

134
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,700
pear charlotte, chocolate mousse,

135
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,780
and the sorbets and the private sundae.

136
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,680
What is your private cut?

137
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,780
These are candied chestnuts with cognac.

138
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
vanilla ice cream

139
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,220
and fresh cream on top.

140
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,460
Okay, I'll take that.

141
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
And we have calories before that.

142
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,900
It's a good thing you weren't hungry.

143
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,780
For me, it will be a sorbet.

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,080
Pear, raspberry, passion fruit?

145
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,700
raspberry

146
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,020
and you will bring us two express

147
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,760
and the addition

148
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:09,500
You see, Robert, you can see that clearly.

149
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,660
that it's not Mireille

150
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,960
It's Sunday

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,840
On Sundays, Catholics go to church

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,720
and the Protestants go to the temple

153
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,600
And everyone goes to the pastry shop to buy cakes.

154
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,020
All kinds of cakes.

155
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,640
Come on, cream puffs are cakes.

156
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,700
Eclairs are cakes.

157
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,700
The nuns.

158
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,560
And then there are the pies.

159
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,020
Apricot tarts, cornflower tarts, apple tarts, lemon tarts.

160
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,780
There are lots of different cakes.

161
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,580
And do you like cakes?

162
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,880
Oh yes, I really like cakes.

163
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,540
Can you give some names of cakes that can be found in pastry shops?

164
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,160
mille-feuilles, religieuses, rum babas.

165
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
Here is a nun.

166
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
But it's also a cake.

167
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,440
Robert buys a nun's pastry because it's Sunday, no doubt.

168
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,140
Here, Mireille buys a newspaper.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,820
You remember, I bought you this for your birthday.

170
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,820
Ah yes, yes, I remember.

171
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,980
Here, Robert buys a restaurant guide.

172
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,020
And here, Robert buys a croque-monsieur.

173
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,580
Look, here we're going to buy something to taste because the little boy is hungry.

174
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,040
It's the verb "to buy".

175
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,940
Yeah, it's 4:30.

176
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
Why does he keep repeating that it's 4:30?

177
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
He says that because he's hungry and we haven't had a taste yet.

178
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,520
What if we bought something?

179
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,420
Good idea!

180
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,960
You can give this to Eric for his birthday, so he can buy whatever he wants.

181
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,560
Robert enters a restaurant.

182
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,660
He notices a couple with a young blonde woman and he thinks of Mireille.

183
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,280
But it's not Mireille. In fact, it's Mireille's sister, Cécile, and her husband Jean-Denis.

184
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,960
They are having aperitifs. The lady has a martini and the gentleman a Pernod.

185
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,620
Then they look at the map. Let's see, what's there?

186
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,120
First, appetizers.

187
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
What kind of appetizers are there?

188
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,880
Cured meats, grey or pink shrimp, foie gras, duck foie gras, goose foie gras.

189
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,120
Oh, and then there are also Mireille eggs.

190
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,440
Are you familiar with Mireille eggs? No?

191
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,280
There you go, you take some eggs, one egg, some eggs.

192
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,220
But you use hard-boiled eggs.

193
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,920
You take the yolks, you take tuna, canned tuna.

194
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,180
There you go, tuna, fresh tuna, but you're using canned tuna.

195
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,760
So, you mix the tuna with the tomato puree.

196
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:47,460
You take the egg whites and stuff them with the tuna and egg yolk puree.

197
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,660
You take a can of anchovies, some black olives

198
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,740
You put a fillet of anchovy on the stuffed egg and there you go.

199
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,780
Does that sound good to you? That's fine.

200
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,680
Let's see, what else is there?

201
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,520
Perhaps there are snails?

202
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,880
Snails, there you go, a snail, snails

203
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,320
You don't have any snails?

204
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,920
Oh no sir, I'm sorry

205
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,620
There are no snails, but there are oysters.

206
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,920
There you go, oysters.

207
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,840
And then there's raw salmon

208
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,420
Salmon is a fish

209
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,840
After that, what's next?

210
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,220
Fish, poultry, meat

211
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,300
Ah, there's duck

212
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,840
All kinds of ducks

213
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,460
Duck with olives

214
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,720
Duck à l'orange

215
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:44,020
duck with prunes and peaches, duck aiguillettes, duck breast.

216
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,740
What else is there? Let's see.

217
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,740
There is cassoulet, Toulouse cassoulet, a specialty of the Toulouse region.

218
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,240
It's a dish of beans, white beans, with sausage and confit goose.

219
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,800
Is cassoulet light?

220
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,780
Actually, it's not very light, I don't like cassoulet.

221
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,780
What else is there? Ah, there's sauerkraut, garnished sauerkraut.

222
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:18,460
It's made with sauerkraut garnished with bacon, ham, hams, sausages, sausage.

223
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,680
That's fresh sausage.

224
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,440
And these are dried hams and sausages.

225
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,180
Do you remember those dried sausages?

226
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,560
Let's see, what else is there?

227
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
Hey, there's some chicken, Mireille.

228
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,620
Yes, yes, yes, Mireille's chicken.

229
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,540
Yes, it does exist, the Mireille chicken.

230
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,980
You don't know it? No?

231
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,480
You'll see.

232
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,500
You take chicken, chicken cut into pieces.

233
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,400
You take some oil and you stir-fry the pieces of chicken in very hot oil.

234
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,900
You take some eggplants, you cut the eggplants into slices

235
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,840
and you fry the eggplant slices in very hot oil.

236
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,080
Then you take some tomatoes and you sauté the tomatoes in very hot oil.

237
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:00,900
And there you have it.

238
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,740
Cécile doesn't want any chicken, Mireille.

239
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,900
She doesn't want sauerkraut, nor does she want cassoulet because it's too heavy.

240
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,760
It's not easy to digest.

241
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
It's not easy to digest.

242
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,700
It's heavy.

243
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,000
Look, it's heavy.

244
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,300
That's not heavy, it's light.

245
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,980
Light, heavy.

246
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,300
It's heavy.

247
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,320
Look, it's heavy.

248
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,760
Oh, you're so heavy.

249
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,880
Cécile doesn't want sauerkraut because it's heavy.

250
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,900
She wants something light

251
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,940
Like a small omelet

252
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,380
A small herb omelet

253
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,380
There you go, some herbs to flavor the omelet

254
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,540
Last year, Cécile was on a diet

255
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,080
She ate very little

256
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,380
She drank mineral water to stay thin

257
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,480
Monitor your diet

258
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,760
Finally, Cécile and Jean-Denis have some grilled food.

259
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,760
That's grilled fish, grilled red mullet, grilled sardines, a grilled sausage.

260
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,820
That's a barbecue, grilled meat.

261
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,800
Barbecues are very diet-friendly.

262
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,720
I think I'll have a small barbecue.

263
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,580
A ribeye steak.

264
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,160
A ribeye steak is beef.

265
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,880
And what about cooking methods for grilling?

266
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,000
You have the choice between medium, medium-rare or blue.

267
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,420
Right on the mark, please.

268
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,620
And for me, blue.

269
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,460
Is your steak blue?

270
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,500
Ah yes. For once, it's really blue.

271
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,240
For once, it's actually blue. That's exceptional.

272
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,240
Because generally, when you order a rare steak, it's always overcooked.

273
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,260
For once, as an exception, as an extraordinary event.

274
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,100
Generally, Mireille is right.

275
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,120
But for once, it's Mary-Laure.

276
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,780
And 8 x 8?

277
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,900
8 x 8, 64.

278
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,960
Non, 72.

279
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,840
Seventy-two.

280
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,680
No, how silly of me. Sixty-four. You're right.

281
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,000
For once, I'm right.

282
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,480
That doesn't happen often.

283
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,360
Now you are going to speak French.

284
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:21,800
You are at the restaurant, you are Cécile, you are going to order a grilled dish and to start, a plate of raw salmon.

285
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,100
Have you made your choice?

286
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,780
I think I'll have a small barbecue.

287
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,400
A ribeye steak.

288
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,420
I think I'll have a small grilled steak, a ribeye steak.

289
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,280
I think I'll have a small grilled steak, a ribeye steak.

290
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,660
And how is it cooked?

291
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,720
Right on point, please. Right on point, please.

292
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,620
Right on the mark, please.

293
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,740
And where to begin?

294
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,360
The plate of raw salmon, the plate of raw salmon, the plate of raw salmon.

295
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,100
The boy brings the cheese platter.

296
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,900
There is camembert, cantal, saint-andré, brie.

297
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,360
All of this is about cows, cow's cheese.

298
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,480
There are also goats, goat cheeses, all sorts of goats,

299
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,460
Manure, from Valençay.

300
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,640
All of these are goat cheeses.

301
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
And then there's also Roquefort cheese.

302
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,340
That's sheep's cheese.

303
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,540
There you go, sheep.

304
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,540
After the cheese, dessert.

305
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,580
Would you like a dessert?

306
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,780
Oh no, no dessert for me, I'm not hungry anymore.

307
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,920
Let's see what you have.

308
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,700
There's a Bavarian cream, a raspberry tart,

309
00:17:51,700 --> 00:18:14,960
Floating islands, pear charlotte, chocolate mousse, sorbets, raspberry sorbets, raspberries, pear sorbets, there you go, pears, a pear, passion fruit sorbets, there you go, passion fruit.

310
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:37,000
And then there's the privale coupe. Do you know the privale coupe? Look. You take chestnuts, candied chestnuts, you put them in a coupe, you take cognac, you pour it over the candied chestnuts, you take ice cream, vanilla ice cream, and you put the ice cream on top of the chestnuts.

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,240
Then you take some fresh cream, fresh cream, there you go, and you pour it over.

312
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,780
It's not bad, but it's not very light. It's full of calories.

313
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,380
Okay, I'll take that.

314
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,700
And so the calories start piling up. It's a good thing you weren't hungry.

315
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,060
And onward with the calories. Onward. Onward. Onward.

316
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,560
Thank goodness, thank goodness you weren't hungry.

317
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,440
Jean-Denis is making fun of Cécile.

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,040
She said she wasn't hungry, but she looks very hungry.

319
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,260
Donnie, look at Marie-Laure here.

320
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,660
She says she doesn't like chocolate mousse, but she eats it all.

321
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,640
So, is my chocolate mousse any good?

322
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,240
Yeah, but anyway, you know, I don't really like chocolate mousse that much.

323
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:26,940
Ah good?

324
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,320
Well, tell me, is that all that's left?

325
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,700
It's a good thing you don't really like chocolate mousse.

326
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,500
In this restaurant, there are Mireille eggs, Mireille chicken, etc.

327
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,540
And there's also a dessert called Mireille.

328
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,020
Mireille's apricots.

329
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,720
It's a dessert that is made with apricots.

330
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,180
There are eggs à la Mireille, sautéed chicken Mireille, apricots Mireille.

331
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,020
Jean-Denis wonders why.

332
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,800
So he asks the boy.

333
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,540
Why do you have all these dishes called Mireille?

334
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,600
Ah, sir, that's quite a story.

335
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,640
A very sad story.

336
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,360
It's not a cheerful story.

337
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,300
It's a sad story.

338
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,120
Look at Marie-Laure here.

339
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,160
She is sad.

340
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,200
She is not sad here.

341
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,660
She is cheerful.

342
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,500
And Charlotte, here, she was sad.

343
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,900
Listen, Charlotte, we don't want to see you sad.

344
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,560
Look at Jean-Claude here.

345
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,400
He is cheerful.

346
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,720
But here, he is sad.

347
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,760
Well, the story of all these dishes

348
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,720
Her name is Mireille, it's a sad story.

349
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,320
The chef, the cook, had a girlfriend named Mireille.

350
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,760
And that girlfriend died.

351
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,780
She died from indigestion caused by pink shrimp.

352
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,700
She loved pink shrimp.

353
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,080
So she ate too many pink shrimp and she died.

354
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,820
The chief was very sad and he never got over it.

355
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,700
He remained inconsolable.

356
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,860
Look at Jean-Claude here, he is inconsolable.

357
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,100
And look at Marie-Laure, she's sad

358
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,680
But here, she is no longer sad, she is comforted.

359
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,740
She consoled herself.

360
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,560
But the chief himself never got over it.

361
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,800
He was always thinking about his dead girlfriend

362
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,040
And every time he invented a new dish, he called it Mireille.

363
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,260
To honor the memory of his deceased girlfriend

364
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,700
Isn't that sad?

365
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,320
That's very touching, isn't it?

366
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,340
It's very touching.

367
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,780
Okay, now, observe this.

368
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,400
Marie-Laure is carrying her boat.

369
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,720
She carries it, that's the verb to carry.

370
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,100
Now, observe.

371
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,420
She is going to bring her boat to her father.

372
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,120
Bring me your boat, I'll fix it for you.

373
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,000
It's the verb "to bring".

374
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,220
Now, look.

375
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,440
She's going to take her boat with her.

376
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,220
Take your boat with you, you're not going to leave it there.

377
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,900
It's the verb "to carry away".

378
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,300
Carry, bring, take away.

379
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,840
Look at Marie-Laure, she's wearing something.

380
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,540
Here, the boy brings a fork to Aunt Georgette.

381
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,000
Bring me a clean fork.

382
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,500
You will bring me another knife.

383
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,220
Here, the boy takes the glass.

384
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,220
Listen carefully to what the saleswoman says

385
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,020
Is this for takeout?

386
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,600
No, it's to eat right away.

387
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,180
Here, the boy brings the wine to Cécile and Jean-Denis

388
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,580
Here, he brings the cheese platter

389
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,520
Now, observe Robert

390
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,680
He takes the cheese

391
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,860
And now he's having some cheese

392
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,180
Cheese, cheese

393
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,820
Now, observe what Jean-Denis is going to say

394
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,580
I know you

395
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,660
You're going to eat an omelet and in two hours you'll die of hunger

396
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,980
I know you

397
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,920
Jean-Denis is making fun of Cécile a little.

398
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,360
I know you

399
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,680
Observe what Marie-Laure is going to say here

400
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,340
Here, pass me the box of candy

401
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,200
These candies are mine.

402
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,320
Go ahead and give it to me, I'll only take one, I promise.

403
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,380
Yeah, I know you

404
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,440
You say you'll only take one, and then you'll eat them all.

405
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,380
At the end of the meal, Jean-Denis asked for two espressos and the bill.

406
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,140
And you will bring us two express coffees and the bill.

407
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,080
Two express drinks, one express drink, and the bill.

408
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,580
And that's it, it's finished.

409
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,920
Oh no, we forgot to talk about the wines.

410
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,860
Oh dear, that's not good at all.

411
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,360
We need to talk about wines.

412
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,420
Okay, so Jean-Denis consulted the wine list

413
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,300
and he orders a bottle of Muscadet.

414
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,780
He also orders a half-bottle of Moulin à Vent.

415
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,320
A bottle, half a bottle.

416
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,180
He also orders a half-bottle of mineral water.

417
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,680
The French drink a lot of mineral water to eliminate waste.

418
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,220
I need to eliminate it!

419
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,460
Drink, eliminate, drink, eliminate, drink, eliminate!

420
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,040
Monitor your diet and trust Contrex.

421
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,440
Now listen, observe, think, and respond.

422
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,200
What do you buy in a pastry shop? Bread or cakes?

423
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,700
Cakes

424
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,800
Look closely, are those shrimp or foie gras?

425
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,940
These are shrimp

426
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,840
Be careful, this is quite difficult

427
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,800
Is it a duck or a goose?

428
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,500
A duck

429
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,620
Are these oysters or snails?

430
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,200
Oysters.

431
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,640
Is that heavy or is that light?

432
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
It's heavy.

433
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,780
What is she following?

434
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,920
A course or a diet?

435
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,800
A diet.

436
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,180
Is this an appetizer or a dessert?

437
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,220
A dessert.

438
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,200
Look at Marie-Laure here.

439
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,280
Is she sad or is she happy?

440
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:30,120
She's sad, look at Robert, what's he having, cheese or cheese, cheese and here

441
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:39,660
What does he take cheese for? What do we ask for at the end of the meal? And would he bring us two?

442
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:47,140
Express and the bill, what will you have, Mr. Guignol? Well, to start, shrimp.

443
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:55,440
Mireille's eggs, a dozen snails, a plate of raw salmon, and then a chicken.

444
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:08,100
A rare steak with fries, a soucroute, and a cassoulet—well done, Mr. Guignol!

445
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,100
It's good, it's good, it's good.

446
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,100
It's very good.

447
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
I can't take it anymore.

448
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,100
So, Mr. Guignol,

449
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,100
I'll give you a little cheese, a dessert.

450
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,100
No, no, no, nothing. I'm finished.

451
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,100
No cheese, no dessert, no coffee, no bill.

452
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
