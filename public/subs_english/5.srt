2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We need to watch and get involved.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you'll be able to say a few words in French yourself.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What will Mireille look like?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Perhaps small, but healthy, athletic, strong.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Long fingers, oval face, long white hair, blue eyes.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
She has a lively spirit and a certain pride in pleasure.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,140
Good morning ladies, good morning young ladies, good morning gentlemen.

10
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,980
Today, we're going to create a portrait of the young girl in the story. Okay?

11
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,040
If you wish. You're the teacher. You decide.

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,820
Oh no, no, no. I'm just making a suggestion. But we'll discuss it and decide together.

13
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,640
Let's see. Let's try.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,520
Okay. So, in the story, we're going to have a young girl.

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,860
Not an old lady.

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,060
Not a young woman.

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,380
Not a little girl.

18
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,820
But a young girl. Okay?

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,560
This young girl is going to be...

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,100
Indian.

21
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,900
Indian? No way.

22
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,360
She's not going to be Indian.

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,120
She's going to be...

24
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,860
French, of course.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,780
That's it. She's going to be French. It's decided.

26
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,360
And what is his first name?

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,800
Ethel.

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,460
No, no, no, no. Her first name is not Ethel.

29
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,040
But it's a pretty name.

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,900
Perhaps, yes. It's a very pretty name, but it's not a French name. No.

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,360
The girl's first name will be...

32
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,580
Mireille.

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,240
That's it. Her name will be Mireille. That's decided too.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,060
So, let's start with his physical description.

35
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,760
First, is it going to be big or small?

36
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,180
Small or large?

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,020
Big.

38
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,080
Small.

39
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,460
Let's just say it's going to be rather small.

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,560
Not small, small, small, but not very big either.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,740
Rather small.

42
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:13,760
Does she look sturdy? No. She's rather small and she looks fragile. She looks fragile, but actually, she's not fragile at all. She's not sick. Where does her mother work? Do you remember?

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,640
at the Ministry of Health.

44
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,420
She is a department head.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,220
Yes, so you can imagine.

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,560
than with a mother

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,640
who works at the ministry

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,540
of Health, Mireille

49
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,080
is in good health.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
In fact, his health

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,460
is excellent. It is even

52
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
She's very athletic. She does

53
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,760
lots of sport.

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,640
She does karate.

55
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,860
She rides a bike, she skis,

56
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,480
She plays tennis.

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,440
She rides horses.

58
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,480
She goes ice skating, she goes canoeing, she goes hang gliding,

59
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,820
She goes sailing, she goes windsurfing,

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,900
She does swimming, she does fencing,

61
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,540
She does mountaineering, she does athletics,

62
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,240
Everything, really. She's definitely the sporty girl.

63
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,240
Will she be thin or a little plump?

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Thin, obviously, since she looks fragile.

65
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,420
Let's look at the neck now.

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,880
Be careful, the neck is very delicate.

67
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,440
Will she have a long or short neck?

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,280
Let's say she's going to have a rather long and thin neck.

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,080
And the size?

70
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,080
Will she have a slim or thick waist?

71
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,580
She has a slim waist.

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:50,360
And what about her fingers? Will she have short, thick fingers or long, thin ones?

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,280
She has long, thin fingers.

74
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,060
She also has long, slender legs.

75
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:07,280
She has long, thin fingers and long, thin legs.

76
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,020
Let's look at the face now.

77
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:19,280
Will she have an oval, oblong, round, or square face?

78
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,320
What do you prefer?

79
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,480
Oval? Good.

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,020
Will she be blonde, brunette, redhead, or jatin?

81
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,020
What do you prefer?

82
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,780
You don't know? You don't have a preference?

83
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,500
Okay, so she's going to be blonde.

84
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,500
Damage.

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,580
For what ?

86
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,680
Because I prefer brunettes. I like dark hair. Or, or...

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,840
Too bad for you. She's blonde and she'll stay blonde.

88
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,580
Now, will she have long or short hair?

89
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,700
What do you prefer? Short or long ones?

90
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,080
Blondes.

91
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,720
Long hair? Very well. I agree.

92
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,360
She's going to have long, blonde hair.

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:26,900
Now, the eyes. Will she have black eyes? Will she have brown eyes? Will she have grey or green eyes? Or will she have blue eyes?

94
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,940
Blue eyes.

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,500
Blue? Okay, that's settled. She's going to have blue eyes. Both of them. Do you agree?

96
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,060
All right.

97
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,360
Okay, here's a physical description of Mireille.

98
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:48,460
She is rather small, she looks fragile, but her health is excellent and she is very athletic.

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,880
She is slim, has an oval face, blond hair and blue eyes.

100
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,780
Now, let's paint a moral portrait of Mireille.

101
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,980
How is she feeling?

102
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,320
Let's see

103
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,840
First, she is lively

104
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,540
She has a quick mind

105
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,500
Frankly, Mireille is the most intelligent of the three.

106
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,120
Yes, she's quick-witted.

107
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,940
She is very reasonable

108
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,680
She is very sociable

109
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,460
A little mocking, perhaps.

110
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,080
My sister?

111
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,400
Well, let's say...

112
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,240
Let's just say she's often mocking

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,180
But she's not mean at all.

114
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,420
And she has a very good character.

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,840
Her? Good character? Oh dear! No way!

116
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,820
Today, we are profiling Mireille.

117
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,700
Here is an artist painting a portrait.

118
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,020
Here is a portrait by Fragonard.

119
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,400
This is a portrait of Diderot.

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,980
In Paris, you can find portraits on the sidewalks.

121
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,780
A portrait.

122
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:08,840
So today we're going to look at the portrait of the young girl in the story. She's small.

123
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:18,700
She's not tall, she's short, she's short too, this lady is tall, look at this

124
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:27,300
This bird is small, that one is big. A small house, a big house, a small

125
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,980
house, a big house, and this one, is it small or big, it is

126
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:44,360
small and this one is big or small it is big and that's a

127
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:53,100
The girl is small and looks fragile.

128
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:00,240
like a fragile glass, like a fragile flower, like what is fragile?

129
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:10,320
another vase or a Chinese horse, the young girl looks fragile but in

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,140
In reality, it's not fragile at all; it's very solid.

131
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:21,000
Look at this glass, it looks fragile, doesn't it? But it's not fragile.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:31,320
Not at all, he's very sturdy, he looks sturdy but in reality he's fragile, or is that dog?

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,500
He looks mean, but actually he's not mean at all, he's very kind. Look at this!

134
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,760
Sir, he looks mean, but in reality he's not mean at all; he's very kind.

135
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,800
Now, listen to what Mireille says.

136
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Well, you seem to like that

137
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,520
Yeah

138
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,980
Now, listen carefully to what Marie-Laure says.

139
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,600
And who is that?

140
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,860
That's a friend from university.

141
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,480
He seems nice

142
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,040
He is very kind

143
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,860
And he is especially very good at skiing and tennis.

144
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,220
He doesn't look very athletic.

145
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,920
He may not look it, but he is.

146
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,980
The young girl looks fragile, but in reality she is very strong.

147
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,500
She is in good health

148
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,820
No, here she is not healthy, she is sick

149
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,740
But here, she is healthy

150
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,660
Sick, healthy

151
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,160
He looks sick here.

152
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,620
But now, he is in good health.

153
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,320
He is not in good health

154
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,640
But here, he is healthy

155
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,860
This gentleman is not in good health

156
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,020
But this one is healthy

157
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,260
Let's see

158
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:57,160
Will the girl be thin or a little plump?

159
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,760
Thin, a little heavy

160
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,580
Thin, a little heavy

161
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,420
Now, let's see, what's she like?

162
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,500
A little strong

163
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,260
A little heavyset. Thin. A little heavyset. Rather thin.

164
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,500
Will the girl have a thin or thick neck?

165
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,460
Thin, thick.

166
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,920

The feminine waist, thick.

175
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,780
Thick, thick.

Will she have a long or short neck?

177
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,260
Long, court

178

Court

183
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,060
Alright

184
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:33,560
Will the girl in the story have short, thick fingers?

185
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,360

186

211
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,920

212
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,380

He has long legs.

218
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,440
Let's look at the eyes now.

219
00:14:47,440 --> 00:15:06,720
The girl will have eyes. How many? How many eyes will she have? One eye or two eyes? It's up to you. You can choose. One eye, two eyes. One eye, two eyes.

220
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,820
She may have one eye, like a cyclops or a pirate

221
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,320
Or, she may have a thousand eyes, like a fly.

222
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,900
It's up to you, you can choose

223
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:26,680
She can have one eye, two eyes, or three eyes.

224
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,980
So, what do you prefer? What do you choose?

225
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,420
Two eyes

226
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,640
Okay, two eyes, very good, yes, that's the most reasonable option.

227
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,800
Two eyes is very good, it's a good average

228
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,620
So it's decided, she's going to have two eyes

229
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,420
Now, we need to choose the color.

230
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,360
Will she have black eyes?

231
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,260
Will she have green eyes?

232
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,020
Or will she have brown eyes?

233
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,340
Or grey? Or blue?

234
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,760
What do you prefer?

235
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,260
Eyes as black as coal?

236
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:19,260
Eyes as black as a raven, as black as jet, or eyes as green as meadows, as leaves, or eyes as brown, as brown as chestnuts,

237
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:39,040
Or perhaps grey eyes, grey like the North Sea, or mouse grey, or perhaps blue eyes, blue like the sky when it is blue, or blue like the sea, blue like the Mediterranean, blue like blue flowers.

238
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,860
Blue, she's going to have blue eyes, it's decided.

239
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,860
Okay, fine, that's settled.

240
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,220
She's going to have blue eyes.

241
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,580
Let's see if you understood correctly.

242
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,900
How many eyes do pirates have?

243
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,700
One eye. Pirates have one eye.

244
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,680
Red, preferably.

245
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,840
But this little girl has two eyes.

246
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,420
Two blue eyes.

247
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,680
She has eyes...

248
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,020
Funny.

249
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,320
"But Mireille has blue eyes."

250
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,120
"She has blue eyes, yes, but she could have green eyes."

251
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,720
"Or perhaps her eyes are cooked."

252
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,000
"Yes, but in the story, she's going to have blue eyes."

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,960
Look at this young girl.

She is very intelligent, very quick-witted.

321
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,600
Honestly, Mireille is the most intelligent of the three.

322
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,040
She is very intelligent, quick-witted, and fast-talking.

327
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,460
She likes to make fun of people

328
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,300
Look at her here, she's making fun of Marie-Laure

329
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,460
Look at yourself there

330
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,660
You're pretty

331
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,980
Oh la la

332
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,620
Now look at these two soldiers.

333
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,700
They are mocking too

334
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,740
They are making fun of Robert

335
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,020
Eddy, did you see the butcher boy walking his girlfriend around?

336
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,600
These soldiers are mocking too.

337
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,340
These children are mocking

338
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,040
They make fun of their father

339
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,840
The children are mocking

340
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,500
He too is mocking

341
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,560
Mireille is mocking

342
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,380
She too is mocking

343
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,060
Mireille is mocking, but she's not mean.

344
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,140
No, she's not mean at all.

345
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,820
She is very kind

346
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,540
He is mean

347
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,540
She is kind

348
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,800
A vicious dog

349
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,940
Beware, vicious dog

350
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,680
Beware, naughty child

351
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,600
He is mean

352
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,120
He too is mean

353
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,560
They too are wicked.

354
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,280
And she's mean too.

355
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,140
But Mireille isn't mean.

356
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,920
She is very reasonable

357
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,660
But Marie-Laure is not reasonable.

358
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,140
Look

359
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,780
Marie-Laure, you're not being reasonable

360
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,740
You're going to be sick

361
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,920
Too bad

362
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,840
I think I'm going to be sick

363
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:44,800
Too bad for you, too bad, yes, yes, my watch, oh oh, and my watch, my watch, my watch, too bad, too bad

364
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:56,220
Mireille is witty, intelligent, reasonable, and has a good character, look at Uncle!

365
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:17,220
Guillaume, Uncle Guillaume has a good character, but this gentleman does not have a good character, he has

366
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,460
This lady is also ill-tempered; she has a bad temper.

367
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:35,680
He too has a bad temper, this little girl has a bad temper, but what is it?

368
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:42,900
You think I have time to go to the movies? Oh, but you're bothering me, she has a bad temper and

369
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,140
Mireille, does she have a good character? Her mother says she has a good character, but she isn't

370
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:55,380
She's not mean at all and has a very good character, but Marie-Laure doesn't agree.

371
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:04,260
Her personality, no way, everything annoys her, she's mean. Hey, do you remember if you continue?

372
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:18,540
This is going to end badly, you remember? I remember that slap, you remember?

373
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:32,820
Mireille doesn't remember, and that's who I am, I don't remember, you don't remember

374
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,540
No, I don't remember.

375
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,260
Too bad, he seems nice.

376
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,720
He remembers.

377
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,320
Let's see what you remember.

Blonde.

Lenses.

She's not mean at all.

390
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,220
She's reasonable, yes.

391
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,980
She is reasonable and has a good character.

392
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,540
She has a bad temper.

393

No, she has a very good character.

No, she has a bad temper.

395
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,380
You're the one with the bad temper.

396
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,240
I have a good character.

397
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,460
