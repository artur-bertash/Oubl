00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,880
and fly away. Very soon, you will see what happens and you will be able to say a few things.

3
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,760
Things in French yourself. Robert arrives at Courtois's apartment. No, Mireille. Then, a moment

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,380
Later, she appears. Lunch is delicious, but Robert is a little irritated by Monsieur Courtois.

5
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,240
He's fixated on gastronomy. He'd like to take Mireille home, but all he can do is ask for her phone number.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,320
Robert arrived at the Courtois' house.

7
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,920
The doorbell just rang.

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,700
Ah, my little Robert, there you are.

9
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,700
I'm so glad to see you.

10
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,020
Ah, you look just like your mother.

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,820
May I kiss you, my little one?

12
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,260
Come in, come in. My husband isn't home yet.

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,340
No, she's not here.

14
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,540
Mireille had phoned Madame Courtois on Thursday morning.

15
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,520
It had been weeks since she had seen her godmother.

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,440
Hello, godmother?

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,340
Ah, my little kitty! Is that you?

18
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,920
But it's been ages since we've seen you.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,940
What's become of you?

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,180
Ah, I'm so glad you called. Your timing is perfect.

21
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,740
Listen, come tomorrow.

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,860
Indeed, we will have a charming young American.

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,440
He arrived the day before yesterday, he doesn't know anyone.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,320
He will be delighted to meet you.

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,940
And we'll keep you for dinner.

26
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:03,780
But my queen, I don't know if I could, but Messi, listen, it's been so long since we've seen you

27
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:15,780
Listen, I'll try, I'll see, but I'm not promising anything. Please, sit down then.

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,000
How are you? What do you think of Paris? What have you seen? Tell me a little about it.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,380
How is your mother? Excuse me, that must be Mireille, she's my goddaughter, there she is.

30
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:38,280
But you're as fresh as a daisy, I'll introduce you, but it was time for the states to arrive.

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:47,160
Robert Mireille Bello, my goddaughter, she's almost like our daughter, they pretend not to

32
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,520
not knowing each other, that's it now, the courteous ones must never discover the encounter

33
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,620
On Wednesday, Robert and Mireille will have to keep the secret that life is complicated. Sit down.

34
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,020
Sit down, my children, you're not going to stay standing. Here, my little kitty, you're going to sit down.

35
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:17,120
You've been next to me for so long, I haven't seen you! Oh, you're our daughter too! Yes, you're jealous.

36
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,460
Oh, how jealous she is.

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,840
Excuse me, I'm going to see what's happening in the kitchen.

38
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,640
Robert and Mireille were left alone for a moment.

39
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,180
But Mr. Courtois arrives just at that moment.

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,940
Hello, hello.

41
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,060
Excuse me, I'm a little late.

42
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,820
Work, you know what that is.

43
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,920
Good evening, my old deer.

44
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,780
How are you?

45
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,740
Good evening, my dear Mireille.

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,380
I'm glad to see you.

47
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,060
It's been a long time since we've seen you. What's going on?

48
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,380
Is this for studies? Or a lover?

49
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,080
And here is our young American.

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,000
Actually, I'll be going to the United States in September.

51
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,660
You'll have to give me some tips.

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,880
But in the meantime, will you have something?

53
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,660
And here are the appetizers.

54
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,620
Let's see.

55
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,380
What can I offer you?

56
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:18,380
Whiskey, Campari, Keres, Banius, Pastis, Porto...

57
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,380
A finger of Port, please.

58
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,380
A finger like this or a finger like that?

59
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,380
A finger like this.

60
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,380
And you, my little Mireille, what will you have?

61
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Well, a nice, firm Pastis, as usual.

62
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:50,600
And you, Bibi, what can I give you?

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,280
So, I will shed a tear of execration.

64
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,040
Mr. Courtois generously uses scotch.

65
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,940
with a small ice cube and very little water.

66
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,340
To ours, to yours.

67
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,900
The conversation begins. They talk first about the weather, then about traffic in Paris, and the international situation.

68
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,760
Mr. Courtois has another glass of scotch, then we return to Paris, to the restaurant, to the self-service, to the fast food, which Mr. Courtois hates.

69
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,720
It's a scandal to see this in France. What a disgrace.

70
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,800
You know, it's no worse than leftovers.

71
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,560
University restaurants may not serve haute cuisine, but at least they serve real, balanced meals.

72
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,800
8:30 PM, we'd starve if we sat down to eat.

73
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,460
Okay, I think we can go to the table now.

74
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:53,380
Let's see, reverse, here to my right

75
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,600
Mireille, you stand there

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
Design, whenever you want

77
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,560
The soup

78
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,680
Ah, soup!

79
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,740
Yes, that is to say, no, it's gazpacho

80
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,900
It's a design specialty

81
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,060
You know, it will be very simple

82
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,380
Trout, leg of lamb, cheese and dessert, that's all

83
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,400
But not like that, Robert, like that

84
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,640
It's delicious

85
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,200
Concepcion, your gazpacho is delicious.

86
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,500
The fish.

87
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:49,280
White wine.

88
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,080
Bibiche, a little white wine?

89
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,800
That's the Chablis you like, the sheep-like one.

90
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,060
A nice little trout.

91
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,440
I think this is my favorite fish.

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,820
Mr. Taylor, you don't drink.

93
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,800
Look at Mireille.

94
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,420
I have a soft spot for Chablis.

95
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,720
Design.

96
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,780
The meat.

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
I think I'll serve you; it will be simpler.

98
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,180
Yes.

99
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:41,480
Ah, Mr. Delors, well-done or rare?

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,460
Well-done, please.

101
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:42,860
GOOD.

102
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,140
Hey Mireille, would you like some beans?

103
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,360
Mireille, I know your tastes.

104
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,480
Robert, help yourself to some potatoes, if you like.

105
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,400
Red wine.

106
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,440
With the roast, Mr. Courtois serves a Léoville Lascaze 66.

107
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:11,600
A red Bordeaux that everyone tastes in reverent silence

108
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,560
Hmm, that leg of lamb is delicious.

109
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,780
I have a small butcher who serves me very well.

110
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,440
He always has very good meat

111
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,360
The salad

112
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,600
Robert, a little salad

113
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,760
The cheese

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,680
Cheese

115
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,840
another red wine

116
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,820
With the cheese, Mr. Courtois serves a red Burgundy.

117
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,480
a Chambertin 76

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,220
And now, dessert!

119
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,400
dessert

120
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,600
design, be careful not to spill

121
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,040
crème renversée

122
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,340
This is Mireille's favorite dessert

123
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,500
M. Courtois organise pour Robert

124
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,100
a tourist tour of France

125
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,320
and gastronomic

126
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:06,600
We must go to Lyon, the ancient capital of Gaul.

127
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,140
Gaul, ancient capital of Gaul, no, it's primarily the capital

128
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:18,960
gastronomy of France, you will eat magnificently there if we were to go to

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:33,900
As for coffee, for that kind of coffee you have to go to Burgundy, to Dijon, I have

130
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:43,080
I once ate scrambled eggs with truffles – a marvel! And speaking of...

131
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,080
For truffles, you absolutely must go to the Dordogne.

132
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:55,600
Yes, the Dordogne Valley and the Périgord region are very beautiful, they're full of

133
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,120
Prehistoric caves like Lascaux and Les Aisilles, yes, that's interesting.

134
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,840
You want it, but for truffles, foie gras, and candied wood,

135
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
And that's...

136
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,780
You'll find it much better.

137
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,060
Alcoholic beverages.

138
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,320
Here you go, Robert.

139
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,720
Try this maniac weapon.

140
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,500
I think you'll like it.

141
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,660
50 years old.

142
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
You'll tell me what you think.

143
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,060
THANKS.

144
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Robert is slightly annoyed by Mr. Courtois' gastronomic obsession.

145
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:40,260
He is looking for a way to escape, or rather, as politely as possible, and if possible, with Mireille.

146
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,520
I hope you'll excuse me, but with the time difference...

147
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,520
How long is it from New York to here? 5 hours? 6 hours?

148
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,400
6 o'clock. I'm falling asleep.

149
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,940
Oh, but it's already half past midnight, my God. I have to go home too.

150
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,000
What a delicious meal and what a lovely evening!

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,160
I don't know how to thank you.

152
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,260
But don't leave yet, you have time

153
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,900
Would you like some more Armagnac?

154
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,780
Isn't it good?

155
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,440
He's amazing, but I absolutely have to go back.

156
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,040
Really ?

157
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,620
In that case, I'll give you both a ride home.

158
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,940
No, no, it's not worth it.

159
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,360
No, godfather, don't bother, come on, you must be tired.

160
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, yes, it doesn't bother me at all.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,500
Anyway, I have to put the car in the garage

162
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:38,980
Thank you again, everything was truly exquisite.

163
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,140
Good evening

164
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:47,940
Mr. Courtois escorted Mireille and Robert each to their respective homes.

165
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,280
First, they stop in front of 18 rue de Vaugirard where Mireille lives.

166
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,500
Robert accompanies Mireille to her door.

167
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,420
She presses a button, the door opens.

168
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,020
Robert barely has time to ask...

169
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,000
When will I be able to see you again?

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,540
I don't know. Give me a call Monday morning around 9am.

171
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,400
So 43, 26, 88, 10.

172
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,560
Good evening and good night.

173
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:24,440
Obviously, Robert has already forgotten the number Mireille just gave him

174
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,120
But it's surely in the directory.

175
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,960
When Robert arrives at the Courtois' house, Madame Courtois kisses him

176
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,880
May I kiss you, my little one?

177
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,960
She kisses him because he is the son of her childhood friend.

178
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,060
Here, Mireille kisses Hubert

179
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,160
She kisses him because he is a childhood friend.

180
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,940
Here, Marie-Laure is kissing Uncle Guillaume.

181
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,640
She kisses her parents before going to bed.

182
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,680
He kisses his parents before going to school.

183
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,400
Here, the lady kisses her head.

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,020
The lovers kiss. They kiss.

185
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,940
So, we don't kiss anymore.

186
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,560
Bye.

187
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,300
Ah, my little kitty!

188
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,640
Now that's a step backwards.

189
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
It happened the day before.

190
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,960
The day before, on Thursday, Mireille called to ask for an invitation.

191
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,200
Is that you? But it's been ages since we've seen you.

192
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,080
It's been a long time since Mireille went to see the Courtois.

193
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,160
It's been a long time since we've seen you. What's going on?

194
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,360
Is this for studies? Or a lover?

195
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,040
It's been a long time since Mireille went to the Courtois' house.

196
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Perhaps because she works a lot, or perhaps because she has a lover, lovers.

197
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,620
But it's been ages since we've seen you.

198
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,180
An eternity. Madame Courtois is exaggerating.

199
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,660
Yes, but it had been ages since I'd heard laughter.

200
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,460
What's become of you?

201
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,060
What's become of you? What are you doing?

202
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,980
What have you been up to? It's been a long time since we last saw each other.

203
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
What are you becoming? That's the verb "to become".

204
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,280
Your timing is perfect. Listen, come tomorrow.

205
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,300
Mireille's timing is perfect. She calls at just the right moment.

206
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,400
It's a happy coincidence.

207
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,640
Mireille's timing is perfect. She calls at just the right moment.

208
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,320
But Colette's timing is terrible. She calls at the wrong moment.

209
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,320
Hey, Luc.

210
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,940
Hello, yes?

211
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,820
Bad timing. I was just leaving. I'm late for my class.

212
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,940
No, I really don't have time. I'll call you back tonight, OK?

213
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,200
But here, Marie-Laure is a perfect fit.

214
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,180
She arrives just in time to help her mother.

215
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,240
Ah, there you are, perfect timing. Come and help me.

216
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,360
This is someone who comes at just the right time.

217
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
And someone who falls in the wrong direction.

218
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,900
Now, here's someone who comes along at just the right time.

219
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,080
Ah, Bertrand, that's perfect timing. I was just thinking about you.

220
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,660
The Courtois family will invite Robert and Mireille to dinner.

221
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,440
Madame Courtois is holding Robert back. She is preventing him from leaving.

222
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,620
Yes, yes, you will have dinner with us.

223
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,380
He holds her back.

224
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,160
One second, Marie, one second. I have two words to say to you.

225
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,020
Look at this young woman. She's holding a horse. A horse with wings.

226
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,300
Here, the young girl holds the young man back. That's the verb "to hold back".

227
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Hold me back, Sylvestre!

228
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,940
There's going to be a scandal in this house!

229
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,460
There's going to be a tragedy in this house!

230
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,260
Madame Courtois simply wants to invite Mireille

231
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,000
and invite her to dinner with Robert.

232
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,160
But Mireille didn't say yes right away.

233
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,220
She doesn't promise that she will come.

234
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,120
I'll go see.

235
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,880
But I'm not promising you anything.

236
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,840
Mireille makes no promises.

237
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,140
But Marie-Laure promises everything we want.

238
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,580
Listen.

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,840
Mom, can I go play in Luxembourg?

240
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,900
Okay, but you're going to promise me

241
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,980
that you return at 7 o'clock.

242
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,280
Yes, I promise.

243
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,240
7 hours, I promise.

244
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,280
Yes, yes, I promise.

245
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,060
We will try to be discreet, that's all I can promise you.

246
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,700
It's the verb "to promise".

247
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,500
The Courtois cat is jealous

248
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,160
because Madame Courtois is taking too much care of Mireille.

249
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
The cat is jealous of Mireille.

250
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,980
Oh, you're jealous.

251
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,320
You too are our daughter.

252
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,000
Here, Marie-Laure says that Mireille is jealous

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,960
because she doesn't have a beautiful boat like hers.

254
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
How handsome he is!

255
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,740
You're jealous, aren't you?

256
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,860
Robert and Mireille pretend not to know each other.

257
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,100
They are hiding their meeting from Madame Courtois.

258
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,980
Robert and Mireille have a secret.

259
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,160
Secrets are a good thing, aren't they?

260
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,860
Marie-Laure loves secrets, look.

261
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,600
What are you talking about?

262
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,160
It's a secret.

263
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,580
Little girls love secrets.

264
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,520
Mr. Courtois wants Robert to give him information about the United States

265
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,800
He wants pipes

266
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,580
He wants to know the addresses of good restaurants, interesting things to see, etc.

267
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,020
That's a pipe

268
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,440
A garden hose

269
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
That's a pipe too.

270
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,820
That's a pipe too.

271
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,720
A pipe stem

272
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,900
A stovepipe

273
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,980
Obviously, this isn't the kind of pipe Mr. Courtois wants.

274
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,940
He wants the kind of tip that this young man gives to the gentleman

275
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,300
Information

276
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,120
Actually, I'm going to the United States in September.

277
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,780
You'll have to give me some tips.

278
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,940
But in the meantime, will you have something?

279
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,320
Robert, discreetly, takes a sip of Port.

280
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,640
But Mireille is less delicate.

281
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,660
And you, my little Mireille, what will you have?

282
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,800
Well, a nice, firm little pastis, as usual.

283
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,740
Well, a pastis, a pernaut, a ricard, all that stuff is strong.

284
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,140
And she wants a really strong pastis, that is to say, very strong.

285
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,280
Lots of Pernod and very little water. Packed tight.

286
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,760
Mr. Courtois prefers Scotch. So does this lady.

287
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,840
I'll serve the tea, madam.

288
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,420
Tea, how awful! It's scotch today!

289
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,840
Mr. Courtois likes his scotch well packed.

290
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,300
Lots of whisky and very little water. Listen.

291
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,780
And my Scotch tapes? Compressed, regular, or children's?

292
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:23,860
Normal.

293
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,660
So, I would take a tear of execration.

294
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,700
A drop, a tear.

295
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,020
Mr. Courtois takes some scotch.

296
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,940
He takes more scotch.

297
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,360
Here, he takes some cheese.

298
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,020
And then he takes more cheese.

299
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,700
This veal is delicious.

300
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,380
Sylvestre, Dr. Borodchik will have some more veal.

301
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,240
With a few small carrots, oh yes

302
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,240
La conversation s'engage

303
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,640
We're talking about traffic

304
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,900
Traffic is very difficult in Paris because there are so many cars

305
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,560
Here's a traffic officer

306
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,520
Finally, around 8:30, we sit down to eat.

307
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,420
It's a simple but well-composed meal

308
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,760
First, we serve soup, a Spanish soup.

309
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,860
Next, a fish dish, trout, is served.

310
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,000
Then, a meat dish was served.

311
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,900
The meat dish at the Courtois' house was a leg of lamb or mutton.

312
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,040
How do you prefer your leg of lamb? Well-done or rare?

313
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,340
So, shall I say, well-done or rare?

314
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,260
Madame Courtois has a small butcher who has very good meat and who always serves it very well.

315
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,160
The butcher who serves me very well. He always reserves very good meat for me.

316
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:59,460
With the leg of lamb, Mrs. Courtois served vegetables, green beans and white beans.

317
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,740
And then, she also served potatoes.

318
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,580
Potatoes.

319
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,760
And after the cheese, the drawing.

320
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,340
It was a crème caramel.

321
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,620
Cream.

322
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,980
You pour it into a mold, you turn it upside down, it's a crème renversée.

323
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,540
But you have to be careful not to spill the crème caramel.

324
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,240
Be careful not to spill the crème renversée.

325
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,260
Okay, now we need to look at the question of wines.

326
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,200
With the trout, Mr. Courtois served a Chablis, a Burgundy wine.

327
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,780
A white wine, obviously, with fish, we serve white wine.

328
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,540
With the leg of lamb, Mr. Courtois served a Léoville Lascaze, a very good wine from the Bordeaux region.

329
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:53,200
1966. A very good year. A very great wine. A red wine, of course. With leg of lamb, with red meat, always red wine.

330
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:03,580
And with the cheese, Mr. Courtois served an excellent Chambertin. A Burgundy wine. A very fine wine. Red, of course, with the cheese.

331
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:19,940
Before drinking wine, you must taste it. First, you must look at it, then you must swirl it in the glass, then you must smell it, then you must swirl it in your mouth.

332
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,820
Tasting wine is serious business. It requires concentration and silence.

333
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:45,500
Wine is very important in France. There is wine almost everywhere in France. In the Bordeaux region, the Loire Valley, Burgundy, Beaujolais, Alsace, especially white wines, the Côtes du Rhône, Provence and Languedoc.

334
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:54,600
In France, you have to know your wines; it's part of the culture. The question remains, though, which wine should you serve? Let's see.

335
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,720
What wine should be served with fish?

336
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,500
A white wine, Burgundy or Bordeaux, your choice

337
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,180
And with the meat, with a roast or with a leg of lamb?

338
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,060
Red wine

339
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,880
And with cheese?

340
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,520
Red too

341
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,120
Mr. Courtois is organizing a tourist and gastronomic tour of France for Robert.

342
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,680
We need to go to Lyon

343
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Not because it was a Gallic capital, but because it is a gastronomic capital.

344
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,240
The food is very good there. There are many excellent restaurants.

345
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,940
You should also go to Dijon, in Burgundy, for the same reason. The food there is excellent.

346
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,680
Mr. Courtois ate some fantastic scrambled eggs with truffles there.

347
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,780
Scrambled eggs. It's simple, scrambled eggs.

348
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,220
You break some eggs, then you scramble them, you mix them.

349
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:55,160
Elementary. But these were scrambled eggs with truffles. That makes all the difference.

350
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:03,440
And for truffles, you have to go to the Dordogne. The Dordogne Valley, the Périgord region, that's...

351
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,380
Very beautiful. There are caves with prehistoric drawings and paintings. It's the

352
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:16,000
Homeland of Cro-Magnon man. And for gastronomy, it's fantastic. The truffles,

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,760
Goose confit, foie gras, ceps, and not far away, they make cognac and armagnac.

354
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,400
Mr. Courtois is serving a very old Armagnac.

355
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,000
Fifty years old. You'll tell me what you think.

356
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,460
You'll tell me what you think. I'm sure you'll find it very good.

357
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,820
Look, observe.

358
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,080
Hmm, that cream puff is delicious.

359
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,500
Here, taste this. Let me know what you think.

360
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:51,860
All these gastronomic considerations bore Robert. He wants to escape, to leave.

361
00:23:51,860 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm falling asleep. She's falling asleep from exhaustion. I'm falling asleep from exhaustion. He's falling asleep. He's falling asleep.

362
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:07,520
Sleep. Watch Robert trying to leave. Listen carefully and then you will imitate Robert.

363
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Are you leaving already?

364
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,520
I hope you will excuse me, but with the time difference.

365
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,520
How long is it between New York and Paris? Five hours, six hours?

366
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Six o'clock. I'm falling asleep.

367
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Over to you. You are Robert.

368
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
Are you leaving already?

369
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,520
I hope you will excuse me, but with the time difference.

370
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,520
I hope you will excuse me, but with the time difference.

371
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I hope you will excuse me, but with the time difference.

372
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:45,680
What's the time between New York and Paris? 5am 6am 6am I'm falling asleep 6am I

373
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:58,240
I fall asleep at 6 o'clock. I fall asleep. Mr. Courtois escorts Mireille.

374
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:07,500
Press the button, the door opens. Madame Vélo opens the door. Marie-Laure opens the box.

375
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:25,720
of chocolate and now open your mouths open he opens the closed gate she closes the

376
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:40,480
I close the door, someone opens the window, the window opens, the elevator door opens

377
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:52,900
It's closing, listen, 43 26 88, that's a number, that's Mireille's phone number, that too

378
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,140
It's a number. If Robert doesn't remember Mireille's number, he can find it in

379
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:07,900
the phone book or with Minitel. Now, listen, think, and speak. Mireille is coming to your house.

380
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:13,500
What are you doing? I'm kissing him. Very well. What do we serve here? Soup or the

381
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:21,360
Dessert is soup, and this is a fish dish or a meat dish, a dish of

382
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,160
Fish with the leg of lamb, what does Mr. Courtois serve, red wine or

383
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,580
White wine, red wine, now Mireille, call you.

384
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,780
It's been a very long time since you've seen him, what are you saying, but that

385
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,380
It's been ages since we've seen you, what have you been up to?

386
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,660
Ah, Miss Mireille, it's been ages since we've seen you.

387
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,840
And what about you?

388
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,760
Ah, you've come at just the right time, Miss Mireille.

389
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,280
Actually, I was craving a small ball of gum.

390
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,700
Don't you have a little ball of gum for me?

391
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,800
Ah, you've come at a bad time, Mr. Guignol.

392
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,700
The gumballs, that's not me, that's my sister.

393
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,820
Oh, well, never mind.

394
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:41,360
