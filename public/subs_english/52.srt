3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,760
The next morning, Jean-Michel and Robert met again in place 20-20.

4
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,740
Hello.

5
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,520
Hello.

6
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,480
How long have you been here?

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,140
No, I just arrived.

8
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:25,880
Ah good.

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,020
Is that all you're taking?

10
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,300
Yes, I like to travel light.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
You're carrying a lot of stuff. What's that?

12
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,820
A tent. Hubert is bringing one too.

13
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,880
That way, we can camp without having to find a nice spot.

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,740
There they are.

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,260
Yes.

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,860
Indeed, the mother arrives there with Hubert, Colette and Mireille.

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,460
Hello!

18
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,100
How are you ?

19
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,040
You've been here a long time.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,000
No, we just arrived.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,060
Hey, where do I put all this?

22
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,460
This way.

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,840
Are you selling my bag, my tent?

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,020
Yes.

25
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,200
How are you ?

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,660
How are you.

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,920
Shall we have a quick coffee before we leave?

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,900
Mireille glances at the small cafe on the square and spots the man in black hidden behind his newspaper.

29
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,160
No, we don't have time. See you later on the road. Later.

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,640
Okay, let's get in the car and go.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,500
How do we get started?

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,480
The boys are in front, Mireille and I are behind.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,440
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, there isn't enough room in front, it's going to bother me when I'm driving.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400
So, Mireille, who is small, is in front, and the others are behind.

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,660
No, we'll be packed in like sardines. No, Jean-Michel in front and Robert with us behind.

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,620
Come on, everyone in the car, hurry up.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,660
Okay, so, is that it? Is everyone here?

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,860
Have we forgotten anything?

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,400
No, no, go ahead.

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,160
Here we go.

41
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,460
Let's go.

42
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,080
And they go. The Ariazur sea starts up noisily.

43
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,180
Jean-Michel took the wheel.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,340
At the first intersection, it veers to the left.

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,220
On the right, let's see!

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,520
No, it's on the left!

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,320
I'm telling you, you should have gone to the right.

48
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,120
No, no, no, to the left.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,780
Okay, pass me the card.

50
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,780
Well, right or left, it's all the same.

51
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,720
In the back of the car, Mireille studies the description of Rouen's museums and churches in the guidebook.

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,760
Colette is immersed in Goémio to discover the best restaurants in the region.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,860
In front, Hubert and Jean-Michel are discussing politics.

54
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,860
Marx ! Marx !

55
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,540
But Marc, I saw the last century, my dear friend.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,060
Ah, there, I have a restaurant that looks very interesting.

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,060
A specialty of Saône-Normande.

58
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
It's unbelievable.

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,660
Canard-Rouennais.

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,220
But that's wrong.

61
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,100
False, completely false.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,500
Chicken-Valley-Douge.

63
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,760
It just sounds like a saucepan, that's all.

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,380
But it's you who sounds like a saucepan, my dear friend.

65
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:45,860
Non.

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,620
This is Rouen.

67
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:15,300
They enter the city through narrow and picturesque streets.

68
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,220
They pass under the large clock.

69
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,260
They arrive at the Old Market Square.

70
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,460
Hubert, standing at the front of the car, is acting as guide.

71
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,320
It was in this square that Joan of Arc was burned at the stake.

72
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,220
I wish I had lived in that era.

73
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,860
Do you feel a calling to the stake?

74
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,600
No, on the contrary. I have a calling to be a firefighter.

75
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,860
I've always dreamed of being a firefighter.

76
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,720
I can easily picture myself arriving on my horse.

77
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,500
The firefighters were on horseback back then, I suppose.

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,900
with a magnificent silver helmet plunging into the smoke

79
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,720
and saving Joan of Arc from the flames.

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,660
You would have sabotaged the formation of the French nation.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,560
What a stupid thing to do.

82
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,440
The formation of a nation is due to purely economic reasons.

83
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,600
Mindless materialism.

84
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,200
Where will we be able to park?

85
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,900
Once the Méhari was parked near the Saint-Maclou church,

86
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,300
not far from the cathedral,

87
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,040
Hubert is starting to take a serious interest in the question of lunch.

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,940
Okay, so Colette, where is this famous restaurant?

89
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,540
He shouldn't be far from here, wait, I'll go check.

90
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,360
What day is it, by the way?

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,780
Tuesday.

92
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,520
Tuesday, yes.

93
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,240
Oh darn, that's it!

94
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,420
It's closed on Tuesdays, what are we going to do?

95
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,180
Oh, well, it's not a big deal, we'll just go somewhere else.

96
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,660
That's a shame, though.

97
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,200
Yes.

98
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,380
Okay, listen, I have an idea. We'll buy some supplies and go have a picnic on the banks of the Seine.

99
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,760
Good idea. Very good idea.

100
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,840
Okay then, go visit the cathedral. It's half past noon. I'll take care of the supplies.

101
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,020
I need to push myself through all the closed beauty shops. Meet me at one o'clock in front of the cathedral.

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,840
Perfect. We'll go visit. There you go.

103
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm coming with you. I'll leave you two.

104
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:27,240
You're having fun, aren't you? Well, not me. I'm fed up with hearing Hubert and Jean.

105
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,880
Michel is discussing and Colette is reading menus

106
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,540
Listen, let's leave them and go off on our own, but Robert, we're not going to...

107
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,160
Let's see why, because

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:49,500
They take a few steps in silence.

109
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,720
They walk past a cafe.

110
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,240
And, on the terrace of this cafe, who does Mireille see?

111
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,160
The man in black was hiding behind a newspaper.

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,600
You're not going back.

113
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,540
You see the cafe on the left.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,660
You're not going back.

115
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,300
What's so special about this coffee?

116
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,720
Nothing.

117
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,320
But I just saw a guy I've seen somewhere before.

118
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Is this someone you know?

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,280
Non.

120
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,540
But do you remember the day we went to the cinema?

121
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,640
I waited for you in a cafe.

122
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,960
But he was sitting next to me.

123
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,940
It was the same one.

124
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,960
Seriously, are you sure?

125
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,400
Yes, indeed.

126
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,520
And the most worrying thing is that I saw it this morning.

127
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,680
Place Vavin, before we leave,

128
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,420
to the cafe where Hubert wanted to go.

129
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,580
Did you dream it?

130
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,620
But no !

131
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sure it's him.

132
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,860
And I'm sure I've seen it elsewhere too.

133
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Do you remember the day we went to the Samaritaine?

134
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
We wanted to take a taxi. There was someone inside.

135
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Well, it was him, I'm sure of it.

136
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,860
Do you think so? Did you recognize him?

137
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Yes, indeed!

138
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,860
What is he like?

139
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,860
He is dressed all in black.

140
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,860
He has a twitch in his eyes. He blinks constantly.

141
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Well, I never.

142
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
What ?

143
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
A guy dressed all in black who blinks his eyes?

144
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,860
You know, the day we went shopping at La Samaritaine?

145
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
Yes.

146
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,860
I took a taxi, with a completely crazy driver.

147
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
I was forced to jump out of the moving taxi.

148
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,860
Now that I think about it, this driver is dressed all in black.

149
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,860
My eyes are going crazy.

150
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
Are you sure?

151
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Yes.

152
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,860
The day we went to the Closerie des Lilas,

153
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,860
I went to make a phone call and a guy dressed all in black followed me.

154
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
I'm sure it's the same one.

155
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,860
And later, I saw him again when I was in Luxembourg with Marie-Laure.

156
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Marie-Laure, who always talks about a man in black

157
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
when she tells her tall tales.

158
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Perhaps it's true, she wasn't making it up?

159
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,360
But who is he? What does he want? Why is he following us?

160
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
But who does he follow first? You or me?

161
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Is he a police officer? Is he a terrorist?

162
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Why did you come to France?

163
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Did you kill someone?

164
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Are you a terrorist?

165
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Are you involved in drug trafficking?

166
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,360
No, no. Maybe it's you who's following.

167
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,540
Robert, I think I'm scared

168
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,200
I'm scared because I don't understand.

169
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,140
What are we going to do?

170
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,980
We need to leave right away

171
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,700
Yeah, that's it, let's go join the others

172
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,400
We have to leave without the others

173
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,320
But why?

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,880
Think about it

175
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,240
If the guy has followed us this far

176
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
He saw us leave this morning in the Méhari.

177
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,400
We need to let the others go with the Méhari.

178
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,320
And leave from our side

179
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,440
Come on, come quickly!

180
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,580
Robert and Mireille run to the camel.

181
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,620
I have the whole bag.

182
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Do you have the money?

183
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,580
What ?

184
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,140
Money, cash, lottery money.

185
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,680
Yes.

186
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,400
Take half of it.

187
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,480
Oh no, I'd be afraid of losing it.

188
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,280
You never know what might happen.

189
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,260
Take half of it.

190
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,380
Filons.

191
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,300
And where are we going?

192
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,380
I don't know. The important thing is to get out of here as quickly as possible.

193
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,780
Come on, let's go.

194
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,620
They take their bag and leave a note on the windshield.

195
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,880
Unforeseen and compelling circumstances force us to leave you.

196
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,900
Carry on without us, Pisa, Mireille and Robert.

197
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,780
And they run off through the old streets of Rouen.

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:57,420
Subtitling by Radio-Canada

199
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,700
Where are you going? And you, in Türkiye? Oh, well, us too. Oh, well, that's a coincidence, that's good.

200
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:15,500
Go ahead and get in, thank you.

201
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,040
Ten minutes later, the truck passes an airport; Robert spots a small plane.

202
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,760
who seems ready to leave, he immediately asks the driver to stop. "Can you stop us?"

203
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,900
We haven't arrived yet, I know, but I forgot my toothbrush in this case

204
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,520
Robert pulls out a wad of banknotes and places them in the hands of the bewildered pilot because

205
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,680
Because Robert is an honest boy, even when he's in a hurry.

206
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,760
It's for insurance.

207
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,460
And that's for the gasoline.

208
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,340
Thank you, bye.

209
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,080
And there they were, both of them on the plane, before the pilot had a chance to fully understand what was happening.

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,700
Do you know how to fly?

211
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,060
A little.

212
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,120
Robert tries all the buttons.

213
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,060
Push, pull.

214
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,700
Miraculously, the engine starts to turn over.

215
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:33,020
The plane starts up and, after some understandable hesitation, agrees to take off.

216
00:12:52,700 --> 00:13:22,680
Subtitling by Radio-Canada

217
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,900
Okay, what do I do?

218
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,400
Well, I don't know. Go to the right.

219
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,520
Okay, look, what do you see now?

220
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,400
A castle.

221
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,680
We must be above the Loire Valley castles.

222
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,960
Yes, that's it.

223
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,340
That must be Chinon.

224
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,800
Asé, the curtain, that's Pchévernie.

225
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,100
At Chambord, I think that's Valencay.

226
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,980
Where they make goat cheese.

227
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,980
Yes, that's it.

228
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,380
However, it's not Valencay at all, it's Chenonceau.

229
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,520
What do you see now?

230
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,000
Attends.

231
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,220
I see volcanoes.

232
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
And you?

233
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,580
Yes, of course.

234
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,040
We must be above the central massif.

235
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,580
And now ?

236
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:37,180
I see a fortified city, it's Carcassonne, we're in the South, yes, we're in the South, I see Gallo-Roman arenas, that must be Nîmes or Arles.

237
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,320
This is Nîmes.

238
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,700
Okay, what do I do?

239
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,960
Turn to the right, we're above the French Riviera, yes, yes, it's the Mediterranean.

240
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,380
Now I see mountains

241
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,840
These are the Alps

242
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,060
Oh yes, definitely

243
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,460
That must be Mont Blanc

244
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:03,240
That must be the Verdon Gorge

245
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,340
But what are you doing?

246
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,580
We head back south

247
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,360
There's the sea again

248
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,440
The Calanques of Cassis

249
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,700
Oh, horses!

250
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,660
No, you idiot, they're bulls!

251
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,260
This is the Camargue!

252
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,800
But where are you going?

253
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,960
We're in the Pyrenees now!

254
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,940
What do we do?

255
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,860
Shall we go to Spain?

256
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,960
No, no, we're heading back north!

257
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:43,300
We're on the Atlantic now!

258
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,960
I can see La Rochelle!

259
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,140
We are above Brittany.

260
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,220
A cathedral.

261
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,400
But it's Notre-Dame!

262
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
We are above Paris.

263
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,120
Another cathedral.

264
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,520
I think it's Amiens.

265
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,960
Reims !

266
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,160
Hey, Strasbourg.

267
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,340
We are in Alsace.

268
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,960
Attention, we are going to cross into Germany.

269
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,940
Turn, turn, go back.

270
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Oh, vineyards! We're in Burgundy!

271
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,520
Well, you could say we've crisscrossed the whole of France.

272
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,920
With all the zigzags we've made, the man in black isn't likely to find us.

273
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,780
Oh no, not that. The small plane is descending dangerously.

274
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,440
Come back up, come back up, watch out! Watch out, come back up! Come back up!

275
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,660
Robert managed to climb back up.

276
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,100
But just at that moment, a jet plane crosses the sky.

277
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,560
Robert, who has a quick mind, immediately understood that it was the man in black.

278
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,800
Damn, it's him. He's caught up with us.

279
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,600
What do we do?

280
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
We're going down. Anyway, there's no more petrol.

281
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,600
But be careful, it seems that the landing is the most dangerous part.

282
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,660
Don't worry. We'll land like a butterfly.

283
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,000
Robert manages to land the plane in the middle of a field.

284
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:28,300
Mireille and Robert jump out of the plane and head towards a road they can see not far away.

285
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,520
Finally alone, it's relaxing.

286
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,700
They reach the road and see a signpost.

287
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,640
Robert reads Lyon and adds, because he is beginning to see a great culture.

288
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,040
Ah, Lyon.

289
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,620
The gastronomic capital of France.

290
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,660
Here we go ?

291
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,220
Let's go.

292
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,460
A lady driving a very small car stops.

293
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,360
Where are you going?

294
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,760
In Lyon.

295
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,720
And where in Lyon?

296
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,220
At the train station.

297
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,420
That's exactly my path.

298
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,760
And the lady takes Robert and Mireille away in her tiny car.

299
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,540
and leaves them in front of the Gare de Lyon.

300
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,780
This time, I think that's it, we've sown the seeds.

301
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,540
What do we do?

302
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,840
We're taking the first TGV to Marseille.

303
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,100
We're going somewhere on the coast, nice and quiet in the sun.

304
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,280
We're going to rest from our emotions.

305
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,860
Great. I've always wanted to take the TGV.

306
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:25,380
On the TGV, he gives himself over to a sweet bliss.

307
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,420
I was really scared.

308
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,100
I'm so glad you were there.

309
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,860
The loudspeaker announces...

310
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,760
Ladies and gentlemen, we have just reached our top speed of 270 km/h.

311
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,340
At the speed we're going, I doubt they'll be able to catch up with us.

312
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:48,160
But Robert and Mireille do not see that the black alms, hidden by his newspaper, is there, right behind them.

313
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,320
The Carlton in Cannes, in the afternoon.

314
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,980
Robert and Mireille were able to have two beautiful rooms with balconies overlooking the sea.

315
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,660
breathtaking view of the beach, palm trees and the Mediterranean.

316
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:44,620
Mireille settles into her room

317
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,780
and begins to comb her hair

318
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,240
which are long and thin

319
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,140
in front of the open window

320
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,620
Robert walks towards his balcony

321
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,540
lost in contemplation of the sky

322
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,760
which is blue

323
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,300
like Mireille's blue eyes

324
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,780
What beautiful weather!

325
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,300
Robert ?

326
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,780
But Robert doesn't hear him

327
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,660
Still lost in contemplation of the blue of the sea and sky, he continues to move forward.

328
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,560
What a sea, what a sky, not a cloud in sight.

329
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,320
Mireille, a little surprised not to have an answer, stops combing her hair for a moment.

330
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:40,000
Still no answer, seriously worried. This time she gets up.

331
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,380
rushes onto the balcony, leans over, and sees Robert stretched out on the ground.

332
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:54,640
A male and female nurse put him in an ambulance which starts up with a loud noise

333
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:02,220
It wasn't the police helicopter, but it's surely taking people to the hospital during...

334
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,440
Think of Mireille, because she still has such a sharp mind.

335
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,380
"As long as he only has minor bruises," she thought again,

336
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,580
because she handles the subjunctive mood easily.

337
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,240
At the hospital, Robert is in his bed, bandaged from head to toe.

338
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,880
Mireille put on a white nurse's coat.

339
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,280
She plays the nurse with great talent.

340
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,200
She gives Robert some tea to drink.

341
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,260
Come on, it's nothing.

342
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,860
It's not as bad as it could have been.

343
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,780
It's going to get better.

344
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,800
What time is it?

345
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,280
It's already eight o'clock, I need to get back to the hotel.

346
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,300
You don't need anything?

347
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,540
Above all, be wise, and be careful.

348
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,320
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

349
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,140
And she leaves, her nurse's uniform under her arm.

350
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,080
When she reaches the cardboard box,

351
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,280
She sees the man in black come out and walk towards her

352
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,140
She stopped, terrified.

353
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,500
The man in black also stopped

354
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,840
He looks at her

355
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,400
Slowly, he put his right hand in the inside pocket of his jacket

356
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,540
Mireille closed her eyes

357
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:19,380
When she reopens, she sees the man in black handing her a business card.

358
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,340
Miss, if you'll allow me, it's been a month.

359
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,220
Excuse me, I didn't introduce myself

360
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,460
Yes, it's been a month... What am I saying?

361
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,100
Allow me to... Fred Barzik, filmmaker.

362
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,180
I have to make a film to teach French.

363
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,380
So.

364
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,740
I... I've been watching you since...

365
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,100
I've been trying to approach you for a month now.

366
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,860
Because I'm looking for, you see, a proper French girl.

367
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,820
Pretty, slim, distinguished.

368
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,380
For the lead role, right?

369
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,180
And you are exactly what's needed.

370
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,880
I hope you will be willing to accept the role.

371
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,860
Sir, this is the best day of my life.

372
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,280
I have finally realized my childhood dream of being a nurse and an actress.

373
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,080
What a joy!

374
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,160
In his hospital room, poor Robert is bored.

375
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,000
He listens to the radio to pass the time.

376
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,360
He is half asleep, but suddenly he wakes up.

377
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,760
We have just learned that a bomb has exploded at the Carlton Hotel.

378
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,360
The building is on fire. It is unknown if there are any victims.

379
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,420
Robert springs to his feet.

380
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,220
He leaped towards the door, stopped, and tore off his bandages.

381
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,180
Put on his pants,

382
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,580
And he rushes into the street.

383
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,660
Just at that moment, a fire truck speeding past the hospital.

384
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,180
Robert runs and, thinking he's Tarzan, jumps onto the truck which is obviously headed for the crash.

385
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:24,880
Robert is looking for large-scale eyes

386
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,580
and a window that spews flames and smoke, inviting you to dive in.

387
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,020
But all he sees is smoke.

388
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,800
He then sets off without looking to the right or left.

389
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,440
to rush into the smoke.

390
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,700
But a firefighter stops him.

391
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,640
You can't miss his helmet. Wearing a helmet is mandatory.

392
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,320
Undeterred, Robert takes the firefighter's helmet and heroically plunges into the smoke.

393
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,960
A few minutes later, he reappears, dragged by Mireille, half-fainting.

394
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,820
It must be a mistake. They must have used the wrong script.

395
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,020
Shouldn't it be Robert who emerges from the smoke carrying the unconscious Mireille in his arms?

396
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,720
Yes, yes, that's it. Okay, let's start again.

397
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,040
They disappear again into the smoke.

398
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:18,060
And they reappear a few minutes later, Robert triumphantly carrying Mireille, either unconscious or smiling, in his arms.

399
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,420
It's evening. The smoke has disappeared.

400
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,600
The sun sets over the sea.

401
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,700
Lights come on all along the coast.

402
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,420
It's truly a beautiful spring evening.

403
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,080
A couple holding hands walks away on the beach.

404
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,560
It's surely Mireille and Robert who are off on new adventures.

405
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:38,700
