4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,760
Oh no, no, no, he's not her, no.

5
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,940
It's his little sister Marie-Laure's boat.

6
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,980
Marie-Laure was playing with her boat, and then she fell into the pond.

7
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,080
So she went home to change her clothes.

8
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,120
She lives very close by, just opposite, on the other side of the street.

9
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,340
No, you never know how things will turn out.

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,380
Look, I had a friend in the United States who loved the violin.

11
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,740
He played wonderfully well, a true virtuoso.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,500
He dreamed of giving concerts in all the major cities of the world.

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,380
Well, do you know what he's doing now?

14
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,480
He's not a violinist at all.

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280
He makes sausage at the Chicago slaughterhouses.

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,820
She's like my friend Guylaine's sister.

17
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,740
She wanted to be a pianist and in the end, she works in her dad's office as a typist.

18
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,720
Is that you again? What are you doing here?

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
Are you bothering me?

20
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,360
Stop, you're annoying me and leave this bench alone.

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
Well, it's a public bench, isn't it?

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,320
This bench is not yours.

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,900
It belongs to everyone.

24
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,340
It's a public bench, public bench, public bench.

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,160
It's a public bench in a public garden.

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,860
And the garden belongs to the state, and so does the bench.

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,140
So they belong to me as much as to you.

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,300
Non !

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,540
Well, here's a young girl who will surely become a lawyer.

30
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,800
Or to the Council of State.

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,000
And will defend the interests of society and the state.

32
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,740
Being a lawyer, no, always being on your feet, making big gestures, shouting, it's tiring.

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,960
The Council of State, meh, the Senate, maybe, it's almost across the street from the house.

34
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,080
It's convenient, no subway to get to work, but politics doesn't interest me.

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,340
So what do you want to do then?

36
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,500
I don't know, maybe a plumber.

37
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,180
Plumber? Why? Are you interested in pipes and taps?

38
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,960
Yes, I like playing with water.

39
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,640
And then, Dad said that plumbers earn more than him.

40
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,340
Besides, when you're a plumber, you work when you want.

41
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,040
If a client calls you and you don't feel like going to work,

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,600
Well, we'll just stay home.

43
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,480
Whereas if you want to be an engineer or work in a government ministry,

44
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,160
You have to go to work every day, even if you don't want to.

45
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,500
In life, you never do what you want.

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,060
Look, my dad, when he was young, he wanted to be my sister.

47
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,660
Not Mireille, because Mireille is my sister, yes.

48
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:02,740
Yes, but that's not what I mean. I mean, my sister, like that, it's for people, for those who have back pain.

49
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,240
Well, my dad had cold hands. So, when you have cold hands, you can't succeed like my sister.

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,540
Customers can't stand that. So now they're making cars, because cars handle cold hands very well.

51
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,020
Note that this does not prevent my father from being a very warm man.

52
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
Cold hands, warm heart, as they say.

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,920
Is that what they say?

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,480
Yes, that's a common expression. At least, Aunt Georgette says so. And Grandma too.

55
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,780
My father wanted to become a professional athlete, or a boxer or a football player.

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,100
Now he is vice president of a major international bank.

57
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,000
Sport can lead to anything.

58
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,080
And all the paths interrupt me, as my aunt Georgette says.

59
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,500
In the family, we always talk about a friend who was sure that one day his son would become an ambassador.

60
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,580
But now, the son in question is a representative for a toy company.

61
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,600
My brother-in-law, Jean-Denis, the husband of my sister Cécile,

62
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,480
He wanted to be a truck driver to drive huge trucks.

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,160
One of those 20-ton trucks with 9 or 10 pairs of tires speeding along in a cloud of diesel.

64
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,180
Well, do you know what he's doing now?

65
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,200
He designs jewelry at a jeweler's shop in Place Vendôme.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,180
I have a friend who, in his youth, wanted to become a priest.

67
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,360
However, since last year, he no longer believes in God.

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,860
This is a problem for someone who wants to be a priest.

69
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,760
So, he just joined a large insurance company.

70
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,360
La Providence

71
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,700
All my friends want to be in the movies

72
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,640
And they all think they're felines, curosaoua, or truffons.

73
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,000
They are illusions

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,660
Maybe, but you never know

75
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,000
In any case, making films is still more interesting than being in the industry.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,520
Agriculture, commerce, business, the judiciary, the military, or education

77
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,660
Yes, that's true, but not everyone can work in film or television.

78
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,640
We need industrialists, farmers, traders, businesswomen and businessmen,

79
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,720
judges, teachers, even military personnel.

80
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,340
We also need filmmakers and videographers.

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,680
The trouble with cinema is that, even with a lot of talent, you're never sure of succeeding.

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,080
You can never be sure of anything. You never know what's going to happen.

83
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
But that doesn't matter. Tell me anyway what you're going to do.

84
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,460
Me? You really want to know.

85
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:34,820
Well, I think I'll invite you to have something on the terrace of the Closerie des Lilas.

86
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,080
And what are you going to do?

87
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,480
Well, I think I've accepted.

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,560
And can I come?

89
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,800
But you're still here? What are you doing here?

90
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
Do you know your lessons for tomorrow?

91
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,840
Yeah

92
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,720
And have you done your homework?

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,360
Yeah

94
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,940
And you've finished them?

95
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,040
Almost

96
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,600
Then go finish them, right away.

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,260
Oh, can you be annoying?

98
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,600
Since you are American, you must know English.

99
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,900
Yes, a little.

100
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,080
Can you help me with my English homework?

101
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,960
Maybe.

102
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,080
So, this afternoon, at two o'clock, here, okay?

103
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:31,600
Mireille and Robert are still in Luxembourg.

104
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,020
They are talking about a friend of Robert's who played the violin.

105
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,440
and who wanted to become a professional violinist.

106
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,880
And from a friend of Mireille's who played the piano

107
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,520
and who wanted to become a professional pianist.

108
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,700
If you play the piano very well, you can become a pianist.

109
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,240
If you play the violin very well, you can become a violinist.

110
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,440
If you play the clarinet very well, you can become a clarinetist.

111
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,660
If you play the trumpet very well, you can become a trumpeter.

112
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,740
Robert's friend dreamed of giving big concerts.

113
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,100
It was his dream.

114
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,880
A dream. The little girl is dreaming.

115
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,780
Look at Marie-Laure here. She's dreaming.

116
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
Orange juice.

117
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,760
Oh, sorry. Thank you.

118
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
She's dreaming.

119
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,280
They dream.

120
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,860
Generally, we dream when we sleep.

121
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,000
Have a beautiful dream.

122
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,180
Robert's friend dreamed of giving big concerts.

123
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,760
But you never know how things will turn out.

124
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,780
He does not give concerts today.

125
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,340
They work in Chicago, at the slaughterhouses.

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,440
Because in Chicago, there are two specialties.

127
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,780
Large slaughterhouses and...

128
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,780
What else is there in Chicago?

129
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,880
Wind.

130
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,340
Ah yes, wind, yes.

131
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,780
It must be an American idea.

132
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,140
For the French, there are two things in Chicago.

133
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,560
Slaughterhouses and gangsters.

134
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,380
In Chicago, there are slaughterhouses and gangsters.

135
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,380
What is there in Chicago?

136
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,220
There are gangsters and slaughterhouses.

137
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,080
You see? What was I telling you?

138
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,940
And what about New York?

139
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,760
Skyscrapers.

140
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,820
And there you have it, in New York, there are skyscrapers.

141
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,200
And in London, fog.

142
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,460
And in Paris?

143
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,460
In Paris, the Eiffel Tower and the Folies Bergère.

144
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,240
And that's how you do geography.

145
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Okay, getting back to Robert's friend,

146
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:25,020
Robert works at the Chicago slaughterhouses. He makes sausage. That's fresh sausage. Those are sausages. Dry sausages. One dry sausage, two dry sausages, three dry sausages, four dry sausages, five dry sausages, six dry sausages. Can you say that? Six dry sausages?

147
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,380
Six dry sausages.

148
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:33,020
Well, Robert's friend, who wanted to be a violinist, makes sausage

149
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,060
And Mireille's friend, who wanted to be a pianist, is a typist.

150
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,880
She's a typist; she does word processing.

151
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,600
In the end, she's not a pianist; in the end, she's a typist.

152
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,340
Let's look at this one

153
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:55,940
Ultimately, I think this is the one I prefer.

154
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,400
Mireille and Robert are sitting quite peacefully on their bench.

155
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,020
And here comes Marie-Laure to disturb them.

156
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,120
Is that you again? What are you doing here?

157
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,320
Am I bothering you?

158
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,680
Of course it bothers her

159
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,860
Jean-Pierre Andrew, am I bothering you?

160
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,540
No not at all

161
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,720
Am I bothering you?

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,320
But no

163
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,140
You don't mind if I work there?

164
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,400
No, no, it doesn't bother me.

165
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,820
Are you sure that doesn't bother you?

166
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,340
No, you're not bothering me.

167
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,940
Marie-Laure is annoying.

168
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,200
You can never have any peace and quiet with her.

169
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,700
You are having a quiet conversation with a friend in Luxembourg.

170
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,340
And poof, she falls into the pool.

171
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,520
Oh dear, but we're never at peace.

172
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,380
Look at it here again

173
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,260
She never leaves her sister alone

174
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,800
Stop

175
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,400
Stop it, Marie-Laure

176
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,620
Oh dear, but we're never at peace.

177
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,220
No, we're never at peace.

178
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,340
Stop it, you're annoying me, and leave this bench alone.

179
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:33,380
So what? This bench belongs to everyone. It's a public bench, isn't it? It's not yours. It's a public bench, a public bench, a public bench. It's a public bench in a public garden. And the garden belongs to the state, and so do the benches.

180
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,380
– The bench belongs to the state. It belongs to everyone.

181
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,380
It belongs to Marie-Laure, as well as to Mireille or Aunt Georgette.

182
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,880
Look at Marie-Laure, she's holding a boat.

183
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,820
Whose boat is it? It belongs to her, it's her boat.

184
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,340
The boat belongs to him.

185
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,060
Here, she is holding Fido, but Fido does not belong to her.

186
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,640
He doesn't belong to her. Fido belongs to Aunt Georgette.

187
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,020
Marie-Laure might become a lawyer.

188
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,080
A lawyer, me?

189
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,840
No, always being on your feet, shouting, making big gestures, it's tiring.

190
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,920
The judges are seated, but the lawyers are standing.

191
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,580
So you work standing up, then?

192
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:23,940
Yes.

193
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,020
That's right, just like me.

194
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,560
You work standing up, too.

195
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,880
You're a nurse, I bet.

196
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,060
Oh really? I thought that...

197
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,500
Well no.

198
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,340
Note that it's not just the nurses who are standing.

199
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,140
The lawyers are standing and making grand gestures.

200
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,500
Jean-Claude, please use grand gestures.

201
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,360
The Council of State, meh. The Senate.

202
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,640
The Senate, yes. That's what interests Marie-Laure.

203
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,260
She lives almost opposite.

204
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:13,740
It's convenient for getting to work. No need to take the metro. Because the problem when you work in Paris is that you have to take the metro to get to work.

205
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:30,680
We spend all our time on the subway and then at work, at work. That worker over there is at work. And over there, Marie-Laure is asleep, in bed. Subway, work, sleep.

206
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,780
The Senate wouldn't be bad, but politics doesn't interest Marie-Laure.

207
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,080
Politics doesn't interest me.

208
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,520
Plumber, yes, that interests Marie-Laure. It's a good job.

209
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,160
We play with pipes, with taps.

210
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,260
We earn well, we earn a lot of money.

211
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,180
If you want to work, you work.

212
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,440
If you don't want to work, you don't work.

213
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,100
We stay home and take a nap.

214
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,680
Look at the Bélots here. They're at home.

215
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,640
Aunt Georgette, she's at home here.

216
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,120
This gentleman is at home.

217
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,260
They are at home.

218
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,800
She is at home. He is at home. We are at home.

219
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:32,640
Mr. Bello wanted to be a masseur to massage people who have back pain.

220
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,740
A woman who gives massages is a masseuse.

221
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,820
And a man who gives massages is a masseur.

222
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,580
And a lady who has the same parents as me is a masseur.

223
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,380
That's a masseur.

224
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,300
Masseuse, a masseur.

225
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,120
Is Mr. Bello my sister?

226
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,380
Non.

227
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,860
He is an engineer at Renault.

228
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,960
He manufactures cars.

229
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,580
For what ?

230
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,180
Well, because he always had cold hands.

231
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,980
And my sister's customers don't like cold hands.

232
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,920
Look at this woman.

233
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,620
She doesn't like cold hands either.

234
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,620
That's not right, is it?

235
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,200
Clients of massage therapists don't like cold hands.

236
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,280
They can't stand it

237
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,140
And Mireille can't stand being tickled, look

238
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,100
Stop, I can't stand being tickled.

239
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,440
Clients of massage therapists cannot tolerate cold hands.

240
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,620
So, naturally, one cannot succeed as a masseur.

241
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,300
If your hands are cold

242
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,920
We cannot succeed

243
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,120
Here's someone who succeeded

244
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,040
And here's someone who didn't succeed.

245
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,740
Look at Robert here.

246
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,740
He tries, but he doesn't succeed.

247
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,020
And you know how to say that?

248
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,880
Are the archduchess's socks dry and bone dry?

249
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,020
The archduchess's socks...

250
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,860
He tries, but he doesn't succeed.

251
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,420
To succeed, I succeed, you succeed, he succeeds

252
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,120
We succeed, you succeed, they succeed

253
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,340
Mr. Bello always had cold hands

254
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,180
So, obviously, you can't succeed like my sister if you have cold hands.

255
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,720
Look, Madame Bello thinks Marie-Laure looks tired.

256
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,640
Of course, it's not surprising, it's inevitable, she works all the time.

257
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,480
"You look tired."

258
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:58,000
"Of course, I spend my nights doing homework. That's why I look tired."

259
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,280
Mr. Bello has cold hands, but a warm heart. He is warm and cordial.

260
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,860
Mr. Bello has cold hands, but that doesn't stop him from being very warm. It doesn't stop him.

261
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,500
Look at Marie-Laure here.

262
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,160
She's preventing Mireille from working.

263
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,260
He was a little...

264
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,740
Stop, you're preventing me from working.

265
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,980
Go do your homework.

266
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,400
My throat hurts.

267
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,680
That doesn't stop you from doing your homework.

268
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,980
She may have a sore throat, but she can still do her homework.

269
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,120
Mireille is short.

270
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,680
She looks fragile, but that doesn't stop her from being very athletic, very strong.

271
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,520
Robert's father wanted to be a professional athlete.

272
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,500
He is the vice president of a bank.

273
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,620
Sport leads to everything, and all roads lead to Rome.

274
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:11,000
One path, one path that leads to Rome, another path that leads to Rome.

275
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,840
All roads lead to Rome.

276
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,500
Rome, Italy.

277
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,700
Cécile's husband wanted to be a truck driver.

278
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Truck drivers drive the trucks.

279
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,580
A 4 or 5 ton truck.

280
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,520
A large truck weighing 10 or 20 tons.

281
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,320
With 9 or 10 pairs of tires.

282
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,400
One tire, several tires.

283
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,300
But Cécile's husband is not a truck driver.

284
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:51,480
He doesn't drive huge trucks, no. Ultimately, he works for a jeweler. He designs jewelry. He invents jewelry. He creates jewelry.

285
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,340
He works at a jeweler's in Place Vendôme, where there are some very chic jewelers.

286
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,800
I have a friend who, in his youth, wanted to become a priest.

287
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:20,720
He wanted to be a priest when he was young, in his youth. The trouble, the problem, is that he no longer believes in God. Look at this woman. She used to believe in God, and now she doesn't.

288
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,000
She used to believe in God, but she no longer believes in God.

289
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,680
She believed, she no longer believes

290
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,220
Robert's friend no longer believes in God

291
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,480
He no longer believes

292
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,840
So now he's an insurance agent.

293
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,420
He works for an insurance company

294
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,700
He sells insurance against fire, theft, and accidents.

295
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,620
His insurance company is called Providence

296
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,920
All of Mireille's friends want to be in the movies

297
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,780
They think they're great filmmakers.

298
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,040
They believe they are great filmmakers.

299
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,440
But they are deluding themselves.

300
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,800
Look at Marie-Laure here

301
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,060
She's deluding herself, too.

302
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,380
She believes Mireille will solve her problem.

303
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,760
Look, I don't know how to solve my problem

304
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,720
If you think I'm going to solve your problem, you're deluding yourself.

305
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,780
Oh dear, you're not nice, you're not classy

306
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,940
Everyone is deluding themselves.

307
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,820
We believe we are going to be a great violinist

308
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,120
And then we make sausage in the Chicago slaughterhouses

309
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,000
Note that not everyone can be a violinist or a filmmaker

310
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,540
We also need manufacturers, farmers, and retailers.

311
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,320
Businessmen and women, judges, teachers, military personnel

312
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,060
He's in the army, he's a soldier.

313
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,720
And he, he makes films, he's in the film industry, he's a filmmaker.

314
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:04,400
The problem with cinema is that even with talent, you're never sure of succeeding.

315
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,660
That's the trouble, that's the problem.

316
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,480
Look, observe Marie-Laure who wants to buy some gumballs.

317
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,820
I feel like going to buy some gumballs.

318
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,620
Ben vas-y.

319
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,680
The problem is that I don't have any money.

320
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,680
If you think I'm going to give you money to go buy your gumballs

321
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,760
You're deluding yourself.

322
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,760
The problem with filmmaking is that you're never sure of succeeding.

323
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
You can never be sure of anything

324
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,500
We think we're going to be priests, and then we become insurance agents.

325
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,480
Mireille agrees completely; she knows that you can never be sure of anything.

326
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:51,640
"Oh, you can never be sure of anything. You never know what's going to happen. But that doesn't matter. Tell me anyway what you're going to do."

327
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,900
Do you know what Robert is going to do? Well, he's going to invite Mireille to have something at the Closerie des Lilas.

328
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,180
Here are Robert and Mireille having something at the Closerie des Lilas. They're having a drink.

329
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,340
"Would you like something?"

330
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,740
Marie-Laure also wants to go and get something at the Closerie des Lilas.

331
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,760
And can I come?

332
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,160
Now you will speak.

333
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,520
Listen to this dialogue between Mireille and Marie-Laure.

334
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,040
And can I come?

335
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,360
Do you know your lessons for tomorrow?

336
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,660
Yeah.

337
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,540
And have you done your homework?

338
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,080
Yeah.

339
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,860
And you've finished them?

340
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,600
Almost.

341
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,300
Now it's your turn, you are Mireille.

342
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,780
And can I come?

343
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,120
Do you know your lessons for tomorrow?

344
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,520
Do you know your lessons for tomorrow?

345
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,720
Do you know your lessons for tomorrow?

346
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,500
Yeah !

347
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,160
And have you done your homework?

348
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:47,800
Yeah !

349
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,300
And you've finished them?

350
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,840
And you've finished them?

351
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,380
And you've finished them?

352
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,420
Almost !

353
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,560
Then go finish them right away.

354
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:04,220
The problem for Marie-Laure is that there are always lessons to learn, homework to do.

355
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,760
Phew, I'm done.

356
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,440
Have you done all your homework?

357
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,680
Yes.

358
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,820
Always homework, always lessons.

359
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,860
She's never sure she knows her lessons.

360
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,940
Do you know your lessons for tomorrow?

361
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,300
Yeah.

362
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,380
Do you know your lessons?

363
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,020
Uh, yes.

364
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,600
Do you know them?

365
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Are you sure?

366
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,220
Observe. Marie-Laure knows her lessons.

367
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,240
She knows what 8 x 8 equals.

368
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,120
8 x 8, 64.

369
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
She doesn't know who Bruce is.

370
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,580
Who is this Bruce?

371
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,240
She knows how to jump rope.

372
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,220
It's the verb "to know".

373
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,260
She knows, it's the sound.

374
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,220
She knows Robert.

375
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,100
She knows Colette.

376
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,740
She knows the Latin Quarter.

377
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,860
She knows Brittany.

378
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,000
She doesn't know Bruce.

379
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,680
She doesn't know who it is.

380
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,160
She doesn't know what she's doing there.

381
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
She doesn't know where he lives.

382
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,200
Let's see if you remember some professions.

383
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,300
That gentleman who is playing the trumpet is a trumpeter.

384
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,980
And that's a lawyer.

385
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,100
Those are magistrates, judges.

386
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,920
And that's a masseur.

387
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,460
That's a plumber.

388
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:55,780
And he, the truck driver, he's a truck driver. And this gentleman who makes films, he's a filmmaker. Filmmaking is all very well, it's very interesting, but the trouble with filmmaking is that you're never sure of succeeding, even if you have talent.

389
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,580
Do you know how to spell it, talent?

390
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,020
With a T at the end or a D?

391
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,800
I have talent, I'm going to be a filmmaker

392
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,220
You, talented?

393
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,720
Yes indeed, Mr. Guignol, I have talent.

394
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,700
I have a lot of talent and I'm going to be a filmmaker

395
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,440
I am sure I will succeed as a filmmaker

396
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,120
No, Mr. Robert, you cannot succeed as a filmmaker.

397
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
You don't have enough talent

398
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,980
So, I'm going to be a lawyer.

399
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,660
No, Mr. Robert, you don't speak well enough.

400
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,400
Yes, yes, I'm sure I'll succeed as a lawyer.

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,520
No, you can't succeed as a lawyer.

402
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:36,880
Yes, it does.

403
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,120
But no.

404
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,920
You can never be sure of succeeding.

405
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,480
You can never be sure of anything, no.

406
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,560
You can never be sure of anything.
