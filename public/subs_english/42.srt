2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We need to watch and get involved.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very soon, you will see what happens.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you will be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They won the lottery. 40,000 francs.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But how to spend them?

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Robert wants to travel around France.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Mireille will not commit to it, but she will be looking at the camping equipment.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They're taking a taxi.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But the man in black, already inside, tries to push Mireille.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:22,300
Thursday morning at 7:15 a.m., the phone rings at the bike shop. Mireille comes in, half asleep.

12
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,620
We won on the device, we won, what won, us, you and

13
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,380
And me?

14
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,560
Have we won anything?

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,900
What have we gained?

16
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
400 000 francs !

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,900
Yes, it's in the newspaper!

18
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,900
All tickets ending with the numbers 80 to 27 win 400,000 francs!

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,900
400,000 bucks?

20
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,900
Does this lottery ticket win 400,000 francs?

21
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,900
But you only bought a tenth!

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,880
That's clever!

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm taking the time to choose a winning ticket for the first time in my life, and you're only buying a tenth!

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,100
That's only 40,000 francs.

25
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,100
What is this all about?

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes, what we bought the other day wasn't a whole ticket, it was only a tenth.

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,100
The ticket won 400,000 francs.

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,180
Each tenth earned 400,000 francs divided by 10.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,640
That makes 40,000.

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,380
That's it, right?

31
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,460
You mean we only won 40,000 francs?

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,980
Yes, indeed.

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,140
Note that 40,000 francs isn't so bad.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,420
That's already pretty good.

35
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,380
Now you're rich. What are you going to do with all that money?

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,680
I don't know what you're suggesting, but you could support an opera dancer.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:46,580
which is from the last century where you could buy a deserted island in the Pacific, we're going to

38
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,360
Exploring the Amazon's springs is a common practice these days.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,280
With 40,000 francs you won't get far, it's expensive for Amazon, no, anyway, America

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:14,520
France, you know, I know it a little.

41
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,260
But I had other plans for this summer.

42
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,760
I had thought of Yugoslavia, or Sweden,

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,460
or the Zambezi Falls, or the Ingoissu Falls,

44
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,640
or Niagara Falls.

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,440
You see, what attracted me was more the wild nature,

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,860
the great American wilderness.

47
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,940
Listen, we need to talk about this, but not on the phone.

48
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,840
Couldn't we meet up?

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,800
When ?

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,480
NOW.

51
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,020
No, listen, have you seen what time it is?

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,120
It's not even 7:30.

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,620
I'm not even dressed yet and I have to make Marie-Laure lunch.

54
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, so at 9am?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,740
At, say, 10 a.m., in Luxembourg, near the Medici fountain.

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,600
Okay, fine.

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,280
So, see you soon, goodbye.

58
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,780
Mireille immediately called Hubert.

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,600
Hello, Hubert? What are you doing at noon?

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,600
Are you free? Shall we have lunch together?

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,680
Where?

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,020
At Angelina's on Rue de Rivoli.

63
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,820
Okay, if you want.

64
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
At half past noon, at Angelina's.

65
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,280
Kisses, see you later.

66
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,580
Hello.

67
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,700
And Mireille will prepare breakfast for Marie-Laure.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:11,100
So, Marilo, is that it?

69
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,060
Are you ready?

70
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,540
Yeah, I'm coming!

71
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,940
I can't find my French book!

72
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,600
Hurry!

73
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:31,160
Marie-Laure sits down in front of her bowl of hot chocolate at the kitchen table.

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,040
And makes a slice of bread with a bit of jam on the bottom.

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,580
Jam is like culture

76
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,840
The less you have, the more you spread it out.

77
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,580
As Aunt Georgette says

78
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,440
Robert, on the other hand, will be there from 10:50 AM.

79
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,120
He paced back and forth in front of the Medici fountain.

80
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,320
He has already bought a map of the entire French road network, the Michelin map number 989.

81
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,820
Finally, at 10:10, Mireille arrives.

82
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,620
So, you're here, you took your time? Listen, here's what I propose.

83
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,440
With our 40,000 francs, we rented a car and hit the road.

84
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,360
And now, gently. Don't get too excited.

85
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,500
But, old butterfly, I haven't told you yet that I'm leaving.

86
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,740
You can't let me go alone. I'd get lost.

87
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,720
You know very well that I came to France to find myself.

88
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,760
You'll see, it will be a lot of fun.

89
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,200
We'll go wherever we want.

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,720
You can stop at youth hostels.

91
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,000
Apparently it's very cheap.

92
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,680
Camping will be possible.

93
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,140
And then, from time to time, with all the money we have,

94
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,800
We will be able to stay in the palaces.

95
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,520
Just to see the look on the customers' faces when they see us arrive

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,980
with our backpacks, sleeping bags and three-week-old beards.

97
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,300
But I have no intention of growing a beard.

98
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,000
And besides, I do have a sleeping bag, like all the young ladies from good families.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,380
but I don't have a backpack

100
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,780
And you know, I don't have much camping equipment.

101
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,100
No problem, it's simple, you just have to buy some

102
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,420
If you want, but there's no rush.

103
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,380
In any case, I can't leave for another 15 days.

104
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,300
I have an exam to take on Monday at 8

105
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,120
And then I have to say goodbye to my children.

106
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,600
Which children?

107
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
a group of kids I look after

108
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,820
But if you like, in the meantime, we can go for a stroll in a department store.

109
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,760
If it amuses you, it doesn't commit you to anything.

110
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:28,280
Let's take a taxi.

111
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,820
Now that we're rolling in money, we can afford this luxury.

112
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,360
We're going to take a taxi.

113
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,700
Hey, here's one.

114
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,300
Mireille opens the car door and reverses with a scream.

115
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,220
What is it?

116
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,660
Nothing, it was taken, there was someone inside.

117
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,680
A strange-looking guy dressed all in black

118
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,900
I think I've seen it somewhere before.

119
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,400
He acted as if he wanted to grab my arm and force me into the taxi

120
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
Your sex

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,540
No, I assure you, he came towards me.

122
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,420
A horrible hairy hand

123
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,780
With mourning nails

124
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,600
Bizarre

125
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,380
Bizarre

126
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,620
When the phone rings at the bike shop, it's very early.

127
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:23,080
It's only 7:15. Mireille was still asleep. The phone woke her up. She arrives half asleep. She's still half asleep. Half.

128
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
This is a map of the whole of France.

129
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,120
And that's the southern half.

130
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,440
And that's the northern half.

131
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,180
That's a whole pancake.

132
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,020
And that's half of it.

133
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,780
That's a glass that's full.

134
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,840
And that's a glass that's half full.

135
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,420
That's an empty glass.

136
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,960
And that's a glass that's half empty.

137
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,360
Now, look closely.

138
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,960
Is that glass half empty or half full?

139
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,200
Okay, moving on.

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,780
Look at the Arc de Triomphe. It's sinking.

141
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,760
Now it's halfway in.

142
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,180
Centaurs are half man, half horse.

143
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,120
And mermaids are half woman and half fish.

144
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,800
And Mireille is half awake and half asleep.

145
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,660
Robert and Mireille won the lottery.

146
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:26,780
Yes, it's in the newspaper. All tickets ending with the number 81-27 win 400,000 francs.

147
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,680
They won because their number ends with 81-27.

148
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,120
This number here ends with 4.

149
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,640
This number ends with 0.

150
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,400
A mermaid starts with a woman's head and ends with a fish tail.

151
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,780
And large meals always end with speeches.

152
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,960
We still need to give them the means to be happy.

153
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,060
That's it, the show is over.

154
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,540
Here too, the show is over.

155
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,800
The lottery ticket won 400,000 francs.

156
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,380
400,000 francs? This lottery ticket wins 400,000 francs?

157
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,680
400,000 bucks.

158
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,780
Don't you have 5 bucks so I can fill it up?

159
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,260
Listen to this exchange between Robert and Mireille.

160
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,260
Then, you will play the role of Mireille.

161
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,200
We won.

162
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,300
We won.

163
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,680
But who won?

164
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,840
Us, you and me.

165
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,580
What have we gained?

166
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,920
400 000 francs.

167
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
Yes, it's in the newspaper.

168
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,560
All tickets ending with the numbers 80 to 27 win 400,000 francs.

169
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,920
400,000 bucks?

170
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,080
This lottery ticket wins 400,000 francs.

171
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,580
Now, it's your turn.

172
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,620
You are Mireille.

173
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,600
We won.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,820
We won.

175
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:54,420
We won.

176
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,960
Us, you and me.

177
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,820
What have we gained?

178
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,080
What have we gained?

179
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,820
400 000 francs.

180
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,540
Yes, it's in the newspaper.

181
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,060
All tickets ending with the numbers 80 to 27 win 400,000 francs.

182
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,060
400,000 francs? This lottery ticket wins 400,000 francs.

183
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,060
400,000 francs? This lottery ticket wins 400,000 francs.

184
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,060
400,000 francs? This lottery ticket wins 400,000 francs.

185
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,060
But you only bought a tenth. That's clever then.

186
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,120
Mireille is not happy because Robert only bought a tenth.

187
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm taking the time to choose a winning ticket for the first time in my life, and you're only buying a tenth.

188
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,680
She took the time to choose a winning ticket.

189
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,480
She didn't choose just any ticket, no.

190
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,260
She chose a winning ticket.

191
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,180
She made a special effort to choose this ticket.

192
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,600
She took the time to choose a winning ticket.

193
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,740
Poor Mireille is making a lot of effort.

194
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,960
She is in a lot of pain.

195
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,160
I'm taking the time to prepare your breakfast.

196
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,700
You could at least take the trouble to put the bowls on the table.

197
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,500
The lottery ticket won 400,000 francs.

198
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,020
400,000 francs is a lot.

199
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,660
If Robert and Mireille had won 400,000 francs, they would be rolling in money.

200
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,500
Gold.

201
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,920
Here's someone who's rolling in money.

202
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,740
But Robert didn't buy a whole ticket.

203
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,640
He only bought a tenth.

204
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:52,880
So it's only 40,000 francs, but you're rolling in money, oh well, it doesn't matter

205
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,580
420 francs isn't so bad, 420 francs for a little girl like

206
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:04,280
Marie Laure, it's not so bad, it's actually quite good, and 40,000 francs for

207
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:10,220
Robert Emiré, it's not so bad either, 40 thousand is already quite a lot

208
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,660
France isn't so bad. That's already something.

209
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,720
Now you're rich. What are you going to do with all that money?

210
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,460
Now you're rich.

211
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,860
Now you're rich.

212
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,920
What are you going to do with this money?

213
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,220
What are you going to do with this money?

214
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,560
Marie-Laure has 420 francs. What is she going to do with this 420 francs?

215
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,780
Buying a bicycle?

216
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,260
You'll be able to afford a bicycle.

217
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,160
With 420 francs? No, I doubt it.

218
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,020
Look at Marie-Laure here

219
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,900
She doesn't know what she did with her Asterix.

220
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,280
Ah, there he is!

221
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,380
Now it's his chocolates she can't find

222
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,340
What did you do with my chocolates?

223
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,340
I put them there

224
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,740
What could Robert do with that money?

225
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,000
Well, he could go up the Amazon.

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,520
Going up the Amazon is very common, it's fashionable.

227
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,100
Striped swimsuits? No, that's not done anymore.

228
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,900
It's no longer fashionable

229
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,560
Crinolines are no longer in style either; they're not done anymore.

230
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,940
It's no longer fashionable

231
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,900
But dark glasses, yes, those are very common.

232
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,080
It's fashionable

233
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:29,640
Second homes and restored old farmhouses are also becoming very common.

234
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,560
This has become very common lately.

235
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:51,900
Sending flowers when you're invited to dinner, that's done too. It's customary. And kissing hands, yes, that's done sometimes, but not very often anymore. But shaking hands, now that's done. It's done all the time. Observe.

236
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,940
Well, you'll be able to support an opera dancer.

237
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,860
You could support an opera dancer, although that's not very common these days.

238
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,000
Although it's no longer done.

239
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,260
I'm not interested. Unless you come, of course.

240
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,900
Although that's not done anymore. Unless you come.

241
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,720
These are restrictions. Note the subjunctive mood.

242
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:30,660
"Although it's not done anymore, unless you come. Robert doesn't really want to go up the Amazon because it's not very convenient for swimming."

243
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:43,280
Because of the piranhas, small fish that eat the flesh and leave only the bones. He would prefer to explore France because it's less dangerous.

244
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,400
"Wouldn't you prefer we go explore France? It would be less dangerous."

245
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,780
But no, Mireille has other ideas for her vacation.

246
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,560
I had other plans for this summer.

247
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,040
I had thought of Yugoslavia.

248
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,120
Or Sweden.

249
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,980
Or perhaps the Zambezi Falls.

250
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,660
Or the Ingoissu Falls.

251
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,700
Or Niagara Falls.

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,920
You see, what attracted me was more the wild nature, the great American wilderness.

253
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:37,760
The wild, the vast American wilderness attracts Mireille. She is drawn to it. She longs to go there. Here, it's a shop window that attracts her. Here, it's she who attracts Jean-Pierre. Jean-Claude is drawn to something. There is something that attracts him.

254
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,340
Magnets attract iron objects

255
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,220
And sugar attracts ants.

256
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,500
Robert would like to see Mireille right away

257
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,280
But it's too early

258
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,620
It's not even 7:30.

259
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,420
I'm not even dressed.

260
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,820
She is not dressed

261
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,540
She is in a dressing gown

262
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,280
Here, she is dressed

263
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,780
Here, he is dressed

264
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,220
He is not dressed here.

265
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,740
Here, Mireille is not dressed.

266
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,320
But here, she is dressed.

267
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,480
I'm not even dressed yet and I have to make Marie-Laure lunch.

268
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,300
Mireille is taking care of Marie-Laure's breakfast.

269
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,760
She makes her lunch.

270
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,820
Marie-Laure spreads the jam on her bread.

271
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,780
There's almost no jam left in the jar.

272
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,460
So, she is forced to spread it out.

273
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,880
She spreads it out.

274
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,320
You can spread jam on it.

275
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,040
You can spread paint.

276
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,480
You can spread out a map.

277
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,620
Lace, to show them off.

278
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,420
That's a display of lace.

279
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,860
A display of gloves.

280
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,600
Here is a display of fruit.

281
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,080
One can also showcase one's culture and knowledge.

282
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,680
Look at Marie-Laure here.

283
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,620
She shows off her knowledge of geography.

284
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,960
The Alps, the Pyrenees, the Jura, the Ardennes, the Vosges mountains, the Massif Central.

285
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,960
Marie-Laure, Mont Blanc, altitude?

286
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,620
4807 meters.

287
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:14,100
People who are not very cultured, who don't know much, show off what they do know.

288
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,540
Jam is the same thing.

289
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,900
If you have a lot, you don't spread it out.

290
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,800
If we have less of it, we spread it out.

291
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,700
So, Marie-Laure, is that it? Are you ready?

292
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,920
Marie-Laure is not ready. She is not ready to leave.

293
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,100
But the scouts are always ready.

294
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,820
Dinner is ready.

295
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,760
Dinner's ready. Let's eat right away.

296
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,800
Here, Marie-Laure is ready to leave.

297
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,280
Robert is also ready to leave.

298
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,260
He has already bought a card.

299
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
He is waiting for Mireille.

300
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,580
He paces back and forth.

301
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,280
One step, two steps.

302
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,220
50 steps in one direction, 50 steps in the other.

303
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,800
He's pacing back and forth too.

304
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,860
Finally, Mireille arrives.

305
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,160
She arrives, but she is late.

306
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,680
It took her a while.

307
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,300
You took your time.

308
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,740
She's not in a hurry.

309
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,140
She takes her time.

310
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,660
Marie-Laure too.

311
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,460
Mireille is in no hurry.

312
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,500
But there's no rush.

313
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,760
There's no rush.

314
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,900
Marie-Laure, go do your homework.

315
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,080
Oh, but there's no rush.

316
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,180
Mireille thinks Robert is in too much of a hurry.

317
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,120
And now, take it easy, don't get too excited.

318
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,020
Gently.

319
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,660
Wait for me.

320
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,460
Oh, gently now.

321
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:40,220
back towards the back gently, gently, and gently, but gently she has

322
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,800
Gently, don't get too excited, a minute, a minute, a minute, there's a butterfly, that's it

323
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,140
Very pretty, but it doesn't wait, it's hard to catch.

324
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,260
Wait, wait, just a minute, and just a minute, okay, well, I'm going to do a

325
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,660
A trip to Luxembourg and, just a minute, you're the one doing the dishes

326
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:09,620
Today Robert suggests staying in youth hostels. A hostel is

327
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:16,640
Cheaper than a big hotel, youth hostels are very cheap, as is camping.

328
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,620
It's cheaper than a hotel, obviously. Camping is cheaper than going down to...

329
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:31,800
When you travel to France, do you stay in luxury hotels?

330
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:39,660
modest hotels, often at friends' houses or in small hotels, you do

331
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:48,020
Camping? No, you sometimes stay in youth hostels, no, Robert doesn't want to.

332
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,760
staying in luxury hotels from time to time just to see the faces of

333
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,740
customers to have fun like this here Marie Laure wants the earrings of

334
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,320
Mireille, not to keep them, no, no, no, just to see, just to see

335
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:10,840
The school's not for little girls, there's nothing to see, and then

336
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,580
From time to time, with all the money we have, we'll be able to go down to the

337
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,160
Palaces just to see the look on the guests' faces when they see us

338
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,860
landing with our backpacks, our sleeping bags and our three-inch beards

339
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:25,400
weeks a one-week beard a two-week beard a three-week beard

340
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,020
weeks but Mireille has no intention of letting it grow

341
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:38,440
The customers will make a funny face, Mireille doesn't have one

342
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,160
backpacks, but there's an easy solution, it's simple: just buy one, there isn't

343
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,500
If you buy nothing to eat, you just have to go to a restaurant. The car is...

344
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,560
If it breaks down, we can just ask Uncle Guillaume to lend us one of his.

345
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:01,860
Mireille has an exam by next Monday, but from Monday to next Monday.

346
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:10,360
Monday in eight days today next Monday of Monday in eight

347
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Mireille is looking after a group of kids, kids, there are kids, a girl.

348
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
But I'm not a kid.

349
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:28,360
A kid, a kid, a kid, a kid, kids.

350
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
What are you doing ?

351
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
I'm taking care of my doll.

352
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Oh, you're taking care of your doll.

353
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,360
Yes, I'm taking care of my doll, so what?

354
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:48,320
What exactly are you doing here? But I am in the service of Miss Winchester, she has

355
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,500
asked me to take care of his appointments while he was away. Here's your breakfast.

356
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,680
Oh, that's kind. Very kind. Really kind.

357
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,180
Mireille is willing to go for a walk in a shop.

358
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,300
Take a walk.

359
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,180
Aunt Georgette is taking Fido for a ride.

360
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,480
Okay, I'm going to take a trip to Luxembourg.

361
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,640
Robert takes a stroll down Rue Mouffetard.

362
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,940
But if you want, we can go for a walk in a department store.

363
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,100
If that amuses you.

364
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,260
It doesn't commit you to anything.

365
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,760
It doesn't commit you to anything.

366
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,860
We are not obliged to buy anything.

367
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,320
With their 40,000 francs, Robert and Mireille are rolling in money.

368
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,480
They can afford a taxi. They can afford this luxury.

369
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,060
Look what I bought myself. You'll be able to buy yourself a bicycle.

370
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,220
Mireille bends down to get into the taxi.

371
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,400
He bends down to pick up the newspaper.

372
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,440
She bends down to pick up some papers.

373
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,560
Robert bends down to pick up a coin.

374
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,320
She bends down to pick up a pen.

375
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,760
Mireille bends down and then steps back.

376
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,980
He's backing away.

377
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,080
The car is reversing.

378
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,520
The car is reversing.

379
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,520
Back off!

380
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,320
He's backing away.

381
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,220
Move back towards the back.

382
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,920
Gently, gently.

383
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,800
Mireille stepped back because she saw a horrible hairy hand.

384
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,580
He's hairy. He's hairy too.

385
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,000
This hairy hand had mourning nails, all black.

386
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,420
This is a man in mourning.

387
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,420
A man in mourning.

388
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
A woman in mourning.

389
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,240
She is dressed entirely in black.

390
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,440
A woman in mourning.

391
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,160
Now, observe and speak.

392
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,520
Is this glass completely empty or half empty?

393
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,000
Half empty.

394
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,860
Does this number begin with a 4 or does it end with a 4?

395
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,280
It ends with a 4.

396
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,100
Is this gentleman rolling in money or does he need money?

397
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,240
He's rolling in money.

398
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,880
Are swimsuits like that still fashionable or are they outdated?

399
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,560
That's no longer done.

400
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,800
Does sugar repel ants or attract them?

401
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,420
That attracts them.

402
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,460
Is Mireille ready to go out or is she not dressed?

403
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,120
She is not dressed.

404
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,880
What does Marie-Laure do with the jam?

405
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,080
She pulls them.

406
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,880
Look at Robert. Is he standing up or is he bending down?

407
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,740
They bend down.

408
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,520
And these people, do they stay in a luxury hotel or do they go camping?

409
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,460
They are camping.

410
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,160
What are you doing, Mr. Guignol?

411
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,380
I'm camping, Miss Mireille.

412
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,840
What? You're camping?

413
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,940
Yes, I go camping.

414
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,680
I can't afford palaces, Miss Mireille.

415
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,620
But really, Mr. Guignol, camping in the Luxembourg Gardens.

416
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,200
I can't go on the roads, me, Miss Mireille.

417
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,820
You need a car to travel on the roads.

418
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm not rolling in money, Miss Mireille.

419
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,860
Okay, good evening, Miss Mireille. Good evening.

420
00:26:49,920 --> 00:27:18,920
...

421
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:43,920
