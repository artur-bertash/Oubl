Subtitling by Radio-Canada

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,880
Could you advise us?

6
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,200
Excuse me, camping isn't really my thing.

7
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,540
I don't know anything about it.

8
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm in the goldfish section.

9
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,620
Speak to my colleague over there.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,980
If you want, that's what I think.

11
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,500
Good morning.

12
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:38,920
Good morning.

13
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,540
Good morning.

14
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,140
How much is a tent like that worth?

15
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,020
This model costs 955 francs.

16
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,680
It's an excellent opportunity at that price.

17
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,280
It's a very practical little tent.

18
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,740
It's waterproofed cotton canvas.

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,180
You have a double roof.

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,120
A separate floor mat.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,520
A door with a zipper

22
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,140
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

23
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,120
And what about a backpack?

24
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,720
This way

25
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,700
What do you advise us to do?

26
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,920
It depends on what you want to put in it

27
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,660
Well, our belongings, some clothes and a few supplies

28
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,100
No, I mean how much money you want to put into it.

29
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,540
How much do you want to spend?

30
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,060
No, because we have them at all prices.

31
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,520
Here, this is a very nice article

32
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,220
for 1,200 francs.

33
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,800
Sturdy, lightweight,

34
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,580
three pockets,

35
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,720
and adjustable straps.

36
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,000
You must need a sleeping bag, right?

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,980
Yes, I was an idiot, I didn't bring mine.

38
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,180
What kind of sleeping bag would you use?

39
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,820
Again, it depends on what you want to put in it.

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,880
Look, this one's on sale.

41
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
It costs 174 francs.

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,440
It's nylon reinforced with synthetic fibers, it's the cheapest option.

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,180
In the high-end range, you have this, it's down.

44
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,440
It's very warm, very light, it's what we do best.

45
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,340
You won't find better.

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,420
It's the most beautiful one we have.

47
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,620
In fact, this is the last one we have in this model.

48
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:14,820
So.

49
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:15,980
Good.

50
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,080
Okay, well thank you, we'll think about it.

51
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,340
We will be back.

52
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,160
Bye.

53
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,920
Good day.

54
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,480
Bye.

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:36,160
This is not a joke. We'll have to come.

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,340
I'm not equipped at all, I have nothing.

57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,460
All I have to go for a walk in nature is a swimsuit.

58
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,680
That's a bit insufficient.

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,560
Couldn't we just stop at the clothing section in December?

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,740
That's exactly it.

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:12,040
Okay, listen, you'll buy your own underwear.

62
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,820
You'll manage just fine without me.

63
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,220
There is no danger of you getting lost.

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,540
I have to leave.

65
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,440
I just remembered that I have a date with Hubert.

66
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,120
I'll leave you now.

67
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm curious to see the look on his face.

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,580
when I tell him we won the lottery.

69
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,200
Okay, goodbye.

70
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Shall we talk on the phone?

71
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,600
When ?

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,880
Whenever you want.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:06,220
In the street, she meets Jean-Pierre Bourdon.

74
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,480
Excuse me, miss, miss, do you have a light?

75
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,580
Which she does not recognize.

76
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,920
Here, listen, here's 10 francs, go buy yourself a box of matches.

77
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,480
But, miss!

78
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,520
Miss, miss.

79
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,440
Ah, it's you! What a coincidence!

80
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,760
Well, that's very generous of you.

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,460
I don't like flirts.

82
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,220
Ah good ?

83
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,200
And you're not going to believe this, but I just won the national lottery.

84
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,100
Oh!

85
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,920
Ah, you won the national lottery?

86
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,120
Yes.

87
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Well, that doesn't surprise me, with all that broken white glass.

88
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,520
Ah, you believe in broken white glass too?

89
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,040
Oh no, no, I'm not superstitious.

90
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,360
But broken white glass, now that works every time.

91
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,480
It's true, it never fails.

92
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,820
You believe in broken white glass, but you are not superstitious.

93
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
And you go under ladders, too?

94
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,620
No, never. But that's not because I'm pretentious.

95
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,960
It's because once, one of them fell on me with a pot of paint.

96
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,920
And when you spill a salt shaker on the table, what do you do?

97
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,420
So, I take a little salt and throw it over my left shoulder.

98
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,320
Over your left shoulder? And why?

99
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,960
Because I'm right-handed, you know.

100
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,740
And you squash spiders?

101
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,440
Ah, spiders...

102
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,020
It depends.

103
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,020
In the morning only.

104
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,020
A sudden stop in the morning, a sorrow.

105
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,020
A stop born of evening, hope.

106
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
Obviously.

107
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,020
And would you agree to be number 13 at the table?

108
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
Ah yes, of course.

109
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,020
The number 13 has always brought me luck.

110
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,020
And he looks at the number of the building he is passing.

111
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,020
Oh!

112
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
Ah, yes, yes, ah!

113
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,020
Okay, never mind, that thing doesn't work for me.

114
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,020
Ouch, yes, yes, ouch, ouch!

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
You didn't hurt yourself?

116
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Ah yes, very well yes!

117
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,400
Okay, I have to go. Bye.

118
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,700
Mireille and Robert are going to take a trip to a department store.

119
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:15,020
They have a choice between La Samaritaine, Printemps, Galeries Lafayette, Le Bon Marché, and the Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville.

120
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,320
Department stores are practical and convenient because you can find everything there.

121
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,320
Look at this advertisement for La Samaritaine.

122
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:40,080
Discover La Samaritaine, its car park with direct access to the store, its escalators, its food department, its restaurants,

123
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
Its terrace offers the most beautiful view of Paris.

124
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,660
Discover La Samaritaine.

125
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,120
In a department store, there are a whole bunch of different departments.

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,900
A men's clothing section, a women's clothing section,

127
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,980
an underwear section, a perfume section, a shoe section,

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,500
a goldfish aisle, a food aisle, a sports aisle, everything really.

129
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,860
Robert and Mireille are looking for the camping section because they are thinking of going on a long hike.

130
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:27,260
You can take a tour of Luxembourg, you can take a trip, or you can go hiking.

131
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:39,560
A hike on foot, a bike ride, a horseback ride, a ski tour, or a car tour.

132
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,080
To go hiking, they need camping equipment.

133
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:52,360
A tent, a backpack, a sleeping bag, all of that is camping equipment.

134
00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:01,460
At Vieux Campeurs, you can find camping equipment, mountaineering equipment, and diving equipment.

135
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,840
Here, they manufacture rolling stock for the railways.

136
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:14,240
Equipment that is intended to travel at high speeds must be treated with much more care than equipment that travels at 40, 60, or 100 kilometers per hour.

137
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,840
agricultural equipment.

138
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,400
Robert and Mireille are looking at the tents.

139
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,700
They ask for the prices.

140
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,580
How much is a tent like that worth?

141
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,580
That one is worth 955 francs.

142
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,860
This sleeping bag costs 174 francs.

143
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,280
And Cantal cheese costs 47.50 francs per kilo.

144
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,160
The mushrooms cost 4.50 francs per 250 grams.

145
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,420
And the goat cheese costs 12.30 francs.

146
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,700
The beans cost 16.80 francs per kilo

147
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,160
It's the verb to be worth

148
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,940
It's worth it, it's worth it

149
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,420
A 2CV isn't very expensive.

150
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,680
Not a Diana either

151
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,660
But a Rolls-Royce, now that's very expensive.

152
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,120
Because it's a high-end car

153
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,800
That's what we do best

154
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,180
An Alpine is also a high-end car.

155
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,000
It's very good, it's very good quality

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,400
But obviously, it's expensive.

157
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,900
Look at this sleeping bag

158
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,680
This is a very nice article.

159
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,040
This is a high-end item

160
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,600
It's worth at least 1000 francs

161
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,500
But you can buy it for 500 francs.

162
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,620
Because it's on sale

163
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,820
At this price, it's an excellent opportunity.

164
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,120
Here, it's the wallpaper that's on sale.

165
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,040
It's very cheap. It's a bargain, an excellent opportunity.

166
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,180
An Alpine for 100,000 francs, that's an opportunity, that's an exceptional opportunity.

167
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,300
This tent is also inexpensive; it's an excellent deal.

168
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,240
This model costs 955 francs, it's an excellent deal at that price.

169
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,740
It's a very practical little tent.

170
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:27,760
That's not a very practical system. Electricity is more practical. Look at this tent. It's practical, small, lightweight, and easy to pitch. This one is less practical. This one is practical. This one isn't very practical.

171
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,600
This tent is made of cotton canvas

172
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,920
Here's some Basque canvas.

173
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,460
From the canvas

174
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,280
A canvas for painting

175
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,460
A spider web

176
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,080
The sails of the boats are made of canvas

177
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,900
The tents are made of canvas

178
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,600
Cotton canvas

179
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,500
Cotton

180
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,900
Cotton

181
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,660
There is a floor mat

182
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:13,780
A carpet, a carpet, a flying carpet, a floor mat. The ceiling, the floor, the floor, the ceiling, the floor, the ceiling, the floor.

183
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,620
There's a floor mat and a zipper. There you go, a zipper.

184
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:32,800
There are sleeping bags at all prices, but if you want a good sleeping bag...

185
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,600
This is a high-end item; you have to spend at least fifteen hundred francs.

186
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,800
Fifteen hundred francs, is that what you recommend? It depends on what you want.

187
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:51,120
Put our things in there, clothes and some supplies, no, I mean how many?

188
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,120
How much money do you want to put into it? How much do you want to spend?

189
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
That's a very nice backpack.

190
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:08,260
For 1200 francs, sturdy, lightweight, three pockets, adjustable straps.

191
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,680
Suspenders? Suspenders? What are those?

192
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,120
Suspenders!

193
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,840
A strap.

194
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,680
A motorway slip road.

195
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,820
High-end sleeping bags are filled with down

196
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,980
Down, that's down!

197
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,960
Down is great, it's very light and very warm.

198
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,680
That's what we do best

199
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:43,320
Robert is completely unequipped to go for a walk in nature

200
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,220
He has nothing

201
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,440
He's all set up there, he has everything he needs.

202
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,540
They too are equipped for the holidays

203
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,840
But Robert is completely unequipped

204
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,920
He only has one swimsuit

205
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,800
A swimsuit

206
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,220
An old-fashioned swimsuit

207
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,640
A swimsuit

208
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,160
A two-piece swimsuit

209
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
A one-piece swimsuit

210
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,480
Robert and Mireille are in the underwear section

211
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,480
They sell boxer shorts, short boxer shorts and long boxer shorts.

212
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,300
But Mireille doesn't want to help Robert buy his underwear.

213
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,020
Okay, listen, you'll buy your own underwear.

214
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,380
You'll manage just fine without me.

215
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,760
Remember, to fend for oneself?

216
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,960
Look here, the image is blurred.

217
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,940
Fog.

218
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,180
There is fog here.

219
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,580
Fog.

220
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,160
And these are scrambled eggs.

221
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,540
And that's all a mess, all tangled up.

222
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,920
Cut, cut!

223
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,740
The instant soup has arrived.

224
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,680
And when it smells good of leek, the leek is really there.

225
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,220
It's all jumbled up, all tangled up.

226
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,720
Don't you think that's a bit of an exaggeration?

227
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,580
Cut, cut!

228
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,300
No, no, that won't do.

229
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,900
This is not going well at all.

230
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,420
What kind of work is this?

231
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,800
It's all tangled up!

232
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,600
Okay, let's start again.

233
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,200
And that's a really tangled mess.

234
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,360
But here, she's resourceful.

235
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,040
He's all confused, things aren't going well.

236
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,100
But here, he managed.

237
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
It's okay, he succeeded.

238
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,800
He is very strong.

239
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,580
Marie-Laure is also very strong.

240
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,980
She's very good at chess.

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,200
Failure and math.

242
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,780
Well, you're doing like a champ.

243
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,420
She's also very good at drawing.

244
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,620
Well, you're doing very well.

245
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,200
It's really very good.

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,360
Look at

247
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,280
Let me see

248
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,340
But sometimes, she doesn't do as well.

249
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,920
One

250
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,900
Listen, you're bothering me, sort it out yourself.

251
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,180
Oh, it's all tangled up.

252
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,680
Figure it out

253
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,080
Help me

254
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,880
Figure it out yourself

255
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,060
In the past, workers did not have bathrooms.

256
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,780
But according to Hubert, they managed very well without a bathtub.

257
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,060
They managed very, very well without a bathtub or bidet.

258
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,660
Mireille leaves Robert to go to her date with Hubert

259
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,520
I have to go, I just remembered I have a date with Hubert.

260
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,600
In the street, guess who she runs into

261
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,440
About Jean-Pierre

262
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,080
He doesn't recognize her, but immediately he tries to flirt with her.

263
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,480
Excuse me, miss, do you have a light?

264
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,640
She doesn't recognize him either.

265
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,080
And to get rid of him, she gives him 10 francs to go buy a box of matches.

266
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,620
A match

267
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,640
A box of matches

268
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,840
Tell me, you are very generous

269
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,840
I don't like flirts

270
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,680
Ah

271
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,040
And you're not going to believe this, but I just won the national lottery!

272
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,720
Listen to the little conversation between Mireille and Jean-Pierre

273
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,040
And then you will play the role of Jean-Pierre

274
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,300
And you're not going to believe this, but I just won the national lottery!

275
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,600
Seriously, you won the national lottery?

276
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:04,760
Yes

277
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,220
Well, that doesn't surprise me, with all that broken white glass

278
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,540
Oh, you believe in broken white glass too?

279
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,140
Ah, I'm not superstitious, but broken white glass works every time.

280
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,240
Now, imitate Jean-Pierre.

281
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,480
You're not going to believe this, but I just won the national lottery.

282
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,760
No, seriously, you won the national lottery.

283
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,000
No, seriously, you won the national lottery.

284
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,920
No, seriously, you won the national lottery.

285
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:37,940
Yes.

286
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,980
Ah, but that doesn't surprise me, with all that off-white glass.

287
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,020
Ah, but that doesn't surprise me, with all that off-white glass.

288
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,060
Ah, but that doesn't surprise me, with all that off-white glass.

289
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,140
Do you also believe in broken white glass?

290
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,080
Ah, I'm not superstitious, but broken white glass works every time.

291
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,940
Ah, I'm not superstitious, but broken white glass works every time.

292
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,400
Ah, I'm not superstitious, but the broken white glass trick works every time.

293
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,560
Jean-Pierre says he is not superstitious

294
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,400
He's not superstitious in the slightest.

295
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,580
Oh no no no, he's not superstitious at all

296
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,220
Not for two cents

297
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,660
Two cents is very little

298
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,640
Marie-Laure doesn't have much patience.

299
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,480
She doesn't have an ounce of patience.

300
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,580
I'm fed up, I can't do it

301
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,740
You have absolutely no patience.

302
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,660
Jean-Pierre isn't superstitious in the slightest.

303
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,480
but it doesn't fit under ladders.

304
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,120
A ladder.

305
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,860
Do you remember the fire department's tall ladder?

306
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,940
A ladder is useful when the elevator is out of order.

307
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,460
A ladder.

308
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,860
A ladder.

309
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,480
A ladder.

310
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,240
Jean-Pierre cannot fit under ladders.

311
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,120
Oh no, never.

312
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,860
But that's not due to superstition.

313
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,960
It's because once, one of them fell on me, along with the can of paint.

314
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,840
And if he spills the salt shaker on the table, what does he do?

315
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,980
I take a little salt and throw it over my left shoulder.

316
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,060
He throws a little salt over his left shoulder, because he is right-handed.

317
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,160
He uses his right hand, just like him.

318
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:32,500
But if he were left-handed, like him, he would inevitably throw some salt over his right shoulder.

319
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:39,540
Because if you're left-handed, throwing salt over your left shoulder isn't convenient, it's not practical.

320
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:49,760
So, you see that if Jean-Pierre throws a little salt over his left shoulder, it's not out of superstition, it's because it's more practical.

321
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,040
Well, there's still the question of the spiders.

322
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,640
Here's a spider.

323
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,040
A spider.

324
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,380
A spider.

325
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,860
A spider web.

326
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,820
If you see a spider in the morning, that's not good.

327
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,060
Apparently, it brings bad luck.

328
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,680
But if you see a spider at night, that brings good luck.

329
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,160
Morning spider, sorrow

330
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,740
Evening spider, hope

331
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,660
So, if we see a spider in the morning, we squash it

332
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,360
Because it brings bad luck

333
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,120
We crush it

334
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,800
Do you remember Robert who almost got run over?

335
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,260
There's Robert, he got run over.

336
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,820
Watch out, you're going to get run over!

337
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,100
And there you have it, a crushed tomato.

338
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,940
Ah, and then there's also the story of the number 13.

339
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,260
Some people say it brings bad luck.

340
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,860
The number 13 has always been a lucky number for me.

341
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,980
What do you think?

342
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,600
The number 13, for some, brings good luck, for others, bad luck.

343
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,620
I think it brings me good luck.

344
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,840
I would avoid flying on the 13th

345
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,140
But I would gladly play that lottery number.

346
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,020
Do you go under ladders?

347
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,600
Yes, I can walk under ladders.

348
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,640
That's a superstition that doesn't affect me at all.

349
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,260
And what about spiders?

350
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,980
The house is clean; I don't see much of that at my place.

351
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,220
In the morning, it seems, there is sorrow; in the evening, hope.

352
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,900
No, spiders don't affect me at all.

353
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,740
I find it dirty, but it doesn't bother me.

354
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,220
No, it's not related to superstition.

355
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,240
No not at all.

356
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,180
The broken glass.

357
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,340
Broken glass, I believe, is happiness.

358
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,480
The white glass represents 7 years of happiness, I believe.

359
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,020
Are you superstitious?

360
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
No not at all.

361
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,060
Are you superstitious?

362
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,480
No, not that either.

363
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,900
And you, do you like spiders?

364
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,940
No not at all.

365
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,400
And do you like leeks?

366
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,320
The instant soup has arrived.

367
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,280
And when it smells good of leek, the leek is really there.

368
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,020
The magic soup flakes.

369
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,400
Ouch!

370
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,340
Don't you think that's a bit of an exaggeration?

371
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,900
Cut, cut! No, no, that won't do.

372
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,500
This is not going well at all.

373
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,040
What kind of work is this?

374
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,400
I've got everything tangled up!

375
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Okay, let's start again.

376
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,660
The instant soup has arrived.

377
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,320
I don't have a plate. He's the one eating my soup.

378
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,980
So, is this soup any good?

379
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,880
Magical flake soup, the leek is really there.

380
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,340
Okay, let's start again.

381
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,820
The instant soup has arrived.

382
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,780
And when it smells good of leek, the leek is really there.

383
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,600
The magic soup flakes...

384
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,920
Ouch!

385
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,820
Don't you think that's a bit of an exaggeration?

386
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,400
Cut, cut! No, no, that won't do.

387
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,520
This is not going well at all. What kind of job is this?

388
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,580
I've got everything tangled up!

389
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,700
Okay, let's start again.

390
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,160
The instant soup has arrived.

391
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,460
I don't have a plate.

392
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,820
That's him, he's eating my soup.

393
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,420
So, is this soup any good?

394
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,400
Soup made with machi flakes, the leek is really there.

395
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,020
Now, it's your turn.

396
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,880
Listen, observe, reflect, and speak.

397
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,160
What do you think this is?

398
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,400
A department store or a train station?

399
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,500
A department store.

400
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,120
A department store, yes.

401
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,040
And this is the clothing department?

402
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,600
No, that's the goldfish section.

403
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,740
This is the goldfish section.

404
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,840
Would you say these people are hiking or traveling?

405
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,800
A journey.

406
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,020
A trip, yes, that's it. And this?

407
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,160
A hike.

408
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,180
A hike, very good.

409
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,780
Would you say this is a cheap or high-end car?

410
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,660
High-end.

411
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,720
High-end, yes.

412
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,660
Why does this item only cost 500 francs?

413
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,860
Because he is in...

414
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,660
On sale.

415
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,540
On sale, that's it. Very good.

416
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,320
What is this ?

417
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,660
A rug.

418
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,600
A rug. Very good.

419
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,060
What did this rooster find?

420
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,660
Suspenders.

421
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,600
Suspenders.

422
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,100
What's in high-end sleeping bags?

423
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,620
You dove.

424
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,620
You dove.

425
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,520
Yes. Look at Robert here. Is he well-equipped or does he have nothing?

426
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,680
It is well equipped.

427
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,440
Very good, it is well equipped.

428
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,840
In your opinion, is it a swimsuit or boxer shorts?

429
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,820
A swimsuit.

430
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,540
A swimsuit.

431
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,780
Your little sister climbed a tree and you don't want to help her get down.

432
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,000
What are you saying? What are you saying?

433
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,040
Figure it out on your own.

434
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,700
You managed to get up there, well now, manage to get down there.

435
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,380
Figure it out yourself. Figure it out.

436
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,340
Jean-Pierre doesn't have a fire. What can you offer him?

437
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,580
Matches.

438
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,860
Matches.

439
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,840
Is it a ladder or a staircase?

440
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,820
A ladder.

441
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,180
A ladder.

442
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,640
Is he left-handed or right-handed?

443
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,620
He is left-handed.

444
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,300
Left-handed. And what is that?

445
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,960
A spider.

446
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,780
A spider.

447
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,100
Okay, you've had enough.

448
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,540
You want to leave

449
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,560
What are you saying?

450
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,660
Okay, I have to go, bye

451
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,320
Okay, I have to go, bye

452
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,940
Oh la la

453
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,880
It's getting late

454
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,120
I have to go.

455
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,880
Good

456
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm going

457
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,060
I'll leave you now

458
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,900
I'm going to sleep, not you

459
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,840
When you're sleepy, a good night's sleep is the best thing you can do.

460
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,620
Okay, goodnight. I'm going to bed.

461
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:39,780
