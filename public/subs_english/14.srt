at a cafe and they walk again to the Luxembourg garden lo and behold they

in front of a tobacconist's shop

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,600
and he enters

11
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,860
I would like to send a postcard; it's for Argentina.

12
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,540
By plane? By plane, then it's 6 francs 30.

13
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,640
There you go. 6 francs, 6 francs, 6 francs, 57.

00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,820
57 and 3 lives. There you go, sir. Thank you.

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
Where is he? There's a mailbox over here.

16
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,400
On the left as you leave, sir.

17
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,340
Thank you, goodbye madam. Goodbye sir, thank you.

18
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:31,520
Robert is walking through the streets of the Latin Quarter.

19
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,180
He crosses the Place de la Sorbonne.

20
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,100
He enters the courtyard of the Sorbonne.

21
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,180
He seems to be looking for something.

22
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,520
Something or someone.

23
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,520
He passes under the arches.

24
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,280
He crosses the corridor.

25
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,400
He exits through the gate on school street.

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:19,360
He enters the Luxembourg Garden

27
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,820
He goes before the Senate

28
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,820
Look, there's a young girl on the bench.

29
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,780
Who is it ?

30
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,980
This is not Mireille

31
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,620
What is he going to do?

32
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,620
He's not going back to the Sorbonne?

33
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,700
Yes, but something's wrong. What's wrong with this boy?

34
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,440
Come on, come on, the Latin Quarter is very nice, but there's more to Paris than that, you know.

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,900
There is the Île Saint-Louis, the Éal, Beaubourg, the Eiffel Tower,

36
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,160
Les Invalides, the Champs-Élysées, the museums, the Louvre.

37
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,620
Orsay, Montmartre, l'Opéra.

38
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
No, you're not interested.

39
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,620
You prefer to return to the Sorbonne.

40
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,620
How strange.

41
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,620
Hubert !

42
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,620
Are you here?

43
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Yes, I do come to the university sometimes.

44
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,620
Actually, I wanted to see you.

45
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,680
Later.

46
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,400
Yes of course.

47
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:30,020
But tell me, if your father is a banker, you must be rich.

48
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,200
So why are you staying in a small, shabby hotel?

49
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,040
First of all, my hotel isn't bad at all.

50
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
It's a very decent little hotel.

51
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,880
And besides, my father may be rich, but I'm not.

52
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,600
I prefer to be independent.

53
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,220
Oh really? But then how do you do it?

54
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,280
How do you make a living?

55
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,920
To come to France like that, you need to have money.

56
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,020
Well, when I was little, my grandparents, my father's parents,

57
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,300
they always gave me about a hundred dollars at Christmas.

58
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,380
And also for my birthday.

59
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,220
This is the money I'm spending now.

60
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,520
Ah, I see.

61
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,740
You don't want to take your father's money,

62
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,520
But you have nothing against your grandparents'.

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,180
But tell me, if this is your first time here, you must not know anyone in Paris?

64
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,660
No, not yet. But I have a letter for some people who live on Quai de Grenelle. I plan to go see them tomorrow.

65
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,560
Quai de Grenelle, in one of the towers?

66
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:29,740
Totem Tower, 59 Quai de Grenelle, Mrs. Jacques Courtois. She is a childhood friend of my mother.

67
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,360
Mrs. Courtois? Well, that's fantastic! What a coincidence!

68
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
Do you know her?

69
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,660
Yes, I know her, of course I know her. She's my godmother.

70
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,420
She was my mother's best friend when she was studying medicine.

71
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Madam, is your mother a doctor?

72
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,320
No. Madam, my mother, as you say, is not a doctor.

73
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,660
But she is a department head at the Ministry of Health.

74
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,200
However, my grandfather was a surgeon.

75
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,880
And my father is at Renaud's.

76
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
And what do you do?

77
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,080
I'm studying art history.

78
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,920
And I do karate on Saturday mornings.

79
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
It might come in handy, you never know.

80
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,400
As my aunt Georgette would say.

81
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,480
What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at school?

82
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,900
No, that's not right. It's Wednesday today.

83
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,080
And what are you doing here?

84
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Actually, Mom was looking for you.

85
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,720
Isn't she at the office?

86
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,980
No, she was at home and she was looking for you.

87
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,700
And what did she want?

88
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,560
That, I don't know. It's a mystery.

89
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,800
Okay, I'll go see.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,800
That's it, go and see.

91
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,880
And you, where are you going?

92
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,480
I want to go sailing and I'm going to try out Uncle Guillaume's new boat.

93
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,500
Wait for me if you want, I'll be right back.

94
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,580
Are you Mireille's boyfriend? Are you English?

95
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,720
Why do I look English?

96
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,220
Non.

97
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,580
So, what am I?

98
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,580
Japanese? Spanish?

99
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:07,940
Italian American, what's your name Marie-Laure, and what are your names?

100
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,780
Robert, do you think she's good, my sister?

101
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,780
Robert buys a stamp at a tobacconist's, then he looks for a mailbox.

102
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:35,200
Letters, there's a mailbox on the left here, there's a cafe on the left here, there's a cafe

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:43,460
To the right, and here there's a cafe on the left. Careful now, this is going to be a game. Look closely here.

104
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:50,800
The cafe is on the right or the left, left yes. The taxis are on the right or the left, left, okay.

105
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,760
Okay. And here, are the taxis on the right or the left?

106
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,720
To the right. Okay. And the buses?

107
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,140
Left.

108
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,420
The mailbox is on the left as you go up.

109
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,580
Going up, going down.

110
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,720
Going up, going down.

111
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,800
Going up, going down.

112
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,020
Are you looking for a mailbox?

113
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,780
You have one there, on the left.

114
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,780
Are you looking for a cafe?

115
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:50,780
"There's one there on the right. Looking for a phone booth? There's one there on the left. Looking for a travel agency? There's one there on the right. Looking for a hotel? There's one there on the left."

116
00:09:50,780 --> 00:10:01,460
Marie-Laure seems to be sleeping here. Marie-Laure seems to be looking for something. Robert seems to be looking for something.

117
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:13,280
something or someone here you see someone here you see something someone

118
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,940
Someone, something.

119
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,560
Now, be careful, this is going to be a game.

120
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,280
What do you see there? Someone or something?

121
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,620
Someone.

122
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,280
And here, what do you see? Someone or something?

123
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,840
Something.

124
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,760
And here? Someone.

125
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,060
And here? Someone else.

126
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,300
And here? Something.

127
00:10:40,300 --> 00:11:01,840
And here? Something. And here? Someone. Look, is this woman looking for someone or something? Something. And here, what is the gentleman looking for? Something or someone? Someone.

128
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:15,620
Okay, now, look at this. This is the Sorbonne. Robert is at the Sorbonne. This is the hotel. Robert is at the hotel. This is the Luxembourg Gardens. Robert is at the Luxembourg Gardens.

129
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:22,720
That's the United States. Robert's father is in the United States.

130
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,800
Now it's your turn. Watch.

131
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,620
That's a café terrace. Where's Robert?

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,880
He's sitting on a café terrace. Good.

133
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,820
That's the Sorbonne library. Where is Ousmane?

134
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,500
He is at the library.

135
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,600
That's Mireille's house. Where is Mireille?

136
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:53,200
She's at home, that's the airport. Where's Robert? He's at the airport.

137
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,300
This is the school where the children are at school, this is the Latin Quarter where

138
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,960
Robert is in the Latin Quarter, that's the café where he left off.

139
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:14,200
Robert is at the café, at the café by the departure point, that's the tobacconist's shop where is

140
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:24,420
Robert is at the tobacconist's. That's Luxembourg. Where is Robert? He's in Luxembourg.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,480
Now, look at this. This is the Sorbonne. This is the courtyard of the Sorbonne. This is

142
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,160
The Odéon and the Place de l'Odéon. That's the Latin Quarter. This is a street in the district.

143
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,560
Latin. That's the street with the schools. Yesterday, Mireille was in a hurry because she had to

144
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,580
Bringing Marie-Laure to her dance class. Here, Marie-Laure is bringing Fido to Robert. And

145
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:04,420
She'll take him here. Take him, take him. Today, Mireille isn't in a hurry. Neither is Robert.

146
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,040
He's in no hurry. He's doing nothing.

147
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,460
So Mireille suggests

148
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,800
Robert should go for a trip to Luxembourg.

149
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,840
Shall we take a trip to Luxembourg?

150
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,600
I'm not in a hurry.

151
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,360
Would you like that? Robert agrees.

152
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,380
He's willing. He accepts.

153
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,100
NOW,

154
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,300
Marie-Laure will propose

155
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,880
A candy for Mrs. Belleau.

156
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,760
And Mrs. Belleau will accept.

157
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,860
Listen to what she says in order to accept it.

158
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,300
Do you want a candy?

159
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,300
I'd like that.

160
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,620
Robert and Mireille are going on a trip to Luxembourg.

161
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,880
They are going for a walk in Luxembourg.

162
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,740
Aunt Georgette and Fido are out for a walk.

163
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,260
Here, it's Aunt Georgette who's leading Fido.

164
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,720
Here, Fido is in charge of Aunt Georgette.

165
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,360
Aunt Georgette has Fido in Luxembourg.

166
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,120
Aunt Georgette calls Fido.

167
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,480
I think.

168
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,680
To bring.

169
00:13:59,680 --> 00:13:59,760
To bring.

170
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,780
Take

171
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,720
Walk

172
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,140
But tell me, if your father is a banker, you must be rich.

173
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,380
So why are you staying in a small, shabby hotel?

174
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,940
Robert's father has money

175
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,760
But Robert prefers to be independent

176
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,880
Here is a young boy who is also very independent

177
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,720
Robert wants to be independent

178
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,400
So he doesn't have much money.

179
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,060
He checks into a small hotel

180
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,520
This is not a shabby hotel

181
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,760
But it's not a luxury hotel either.

182
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,200
That's a crappy hotel.

183
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,540
Robert has a little money

184
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,260
Because his grandparents always gave him money at Christmas

185
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,580
And then his grandparents always gave him money for his birthday too.

186
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,240
This is Robert's first birthday, he is one year old

187
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,880
This is Robert's fifth birthday. He is five years old.

188
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,800
Robert was born on October 23rd. His birthday is in October, in the month of October.

189
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,300
Madame Eva's birthday is also in October.

190
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,960
What are we going to wear?

191
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,520
Happy birthday, Ms. Eva! Happy birthday, Ms. Eva!

192
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,240
And when is your birthday?

193
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,740
For me, it's in January.

194
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,120
January is the first month of the year.

195
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,440
It's winter, it's cold. It's cold in February too.

196
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,540
In March, it rains, it's windy, sometimes it snows.

197
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,100
April is almost spring. The first flowers, the buds.

198
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,560
In May, there are flowers everywhere, and little birds.

199
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,340
In June, we make hay. There are cherries.

200
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,160
July is the month of vacation.

201
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,340
In August, we harvest.

202
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,520
It's very hot.

203
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,440
September marks the end of the holidays and the start of the new school year.

204
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
The grape harvest has begun.

205
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,580
October, autumn, the leaves turn yellow.

206
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,920
We're going hunting.

207
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,560
November, the sky is grey, it's All Souls' Day.

208
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,680
December, winter begins again, the Christmas holidays

209
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,200
During the Christmas holidays, we're going skiing

210
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,720
Let's see if you know the months of the year.

211
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Look, is this May or November?

212
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,200
The month of May

213
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,900
And is this March or December?

214
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,700
The month of December.

215
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,820
And is this October or February?

216
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,040
The month of October.

217
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,440
Is this January or July?

218
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,620
The month of January.

219
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,640
And is this February or August?

220
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,100
The month of August.

221
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,260
Robert's grandparents gave him about a hundred dollars at Christmas.

222
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,780
A hundred, a hundred.

223
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,080
9, 10, 11, that's about ten

224
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,780
12, a dozen

225
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,560
15, about fifteen

226
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,220
100, a hundred

227
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,600
1000, a thousand

228
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,120
Let's see how much money Robert has

229
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,460
In the first year, Robert's grandparents gave him $100 for Christmas.

230
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,860
And then $100 for his birthday

231
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,400
That makes 200 dollars

232
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
At age 5, Robert has $1000

233
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,020
At 10 years old, he has $2000

234
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,720
And at 21, he has $4,200.

235
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,980
This is the money Robert is spending now.

236
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,640
He spends his grandparents' $4,000.

237
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,380
He spends this money in France.

238
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,800
He spends this money on the trip, the plane.

239
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,840
He spends this money on the hotel.

240
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,180
He spends this money in cafes.

241
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,020
He spends this money on postcards and stamps to write to his mother.

242
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,340
Marie-Laure spends her money on gumballs

243
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,760
And Mireille in earrings

244
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,680
Here, look

245
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,940
You spend all your money on gumballs

246
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,120
And you, you spend all your money on earrings

247
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,400
Robert spends French money

248
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,680
Pieces

249
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,700
One franc

250
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,300
Two francs

251
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,560
Five francs

252
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,060
Ten francs

253
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,700
Tickets

254
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,360
Twenty francs

255
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,600
Fifty francs

256
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,720
Two hundred francs

257
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,200
200 francs plus 100 francs makes 300.

258
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,080
Add 100 francs, that makes 400.

259
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,920
Add 100 francs, that makes 500.

260
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
Plus 500 francs, which makes 1000.

261
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,500
Okay, let's see if you recognize French money.

262
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,220
That's a 1 franc coin.

263
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,180
That's 2 francs.

264
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,380
That's a 5 franc coin.

265
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,760
That's a 10 franc coin.

266
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,400
That's a 20 franc note.

267
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,160
That's a 50 franc note.

268
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,000
That's a 100 franc note.

269
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,800
That's a 200 franc note.

270
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,340
And this is a 500 franc note.

271
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,140
This is Robert's first time in Paris.

272
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,400
He probably doesn't know many people.

273
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,620
No not yet.

274
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,780
Not yet.

275
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
He will meet people later.

276
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,800
But for now, he doesn't know anyone.

277
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,100
Look at Marie-Laure here. Has she finished her work?

278
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,140
Are you finished?

279
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,980
Not yet.

280
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,060
Look at this young man. Do you think he has children?

281
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,600
Do you have children?

282
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,580
No, not yet. I'm not married yet.

283
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Robert doesn't know anyone in Paris yet.

284
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,940
But he has a letter for people who live in Paris.

285
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,140
And he plans to go see them the next day.

286
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,340
I plan to go see them tomorrow.

287
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,380
He plans to go see them.

288
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,600
He intends to go and see them.

289
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,640
Observe what Mireille says here.

290
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,740
She asks Marie-Laure what she plans to do.

291
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,700
So, what are you planning to do?

292
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,900
Well, go play in the garden.

293
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,380
Have you done your homework?

294
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
No, not yet.

295
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,560
So you're going to do your homework and then we'll see.

296
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,520
Oh !

297
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:39,480
The people Robert plans to visit live on Quai de Grenelle, on the banks of the Seine, in a tower called the Totem Tower.

298
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:52,740
Here is a tower, the Montparnasse Tower, the Eiffel Tower, a medieval tower, a round tower, a square tower, another medieval tower.

299
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,620
The people Robert plans to visit live in a modern tower block.

300
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,240
Totem Tower, 59 Quai de Grenelle, Mrs. Jacques Courtois

301
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,000
She is a childhood friend of my mother

302
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,480
Madame Courtois is a childhood friend of Robert's mother

303
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,500
Here you see Robert's mother and Mrs. Courtois when they were children

304
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,060
They were friends when they were children

305
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,760
They are childhood friends

306
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,500
Robert's mother knows Mrs. Courtois because she is a childhood friend.

307
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,380
And Mireille also knows Mrs. Courtois

308
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,140
Madame Courtois, that's wonderful, what a coincidence!

309
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:35,620
That's quite a coincidence. That's an exceptional encounter. Look, here are some other coincidences.

310
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,020
My mother is French.

311
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,640
Is your mother French? Mine is too. What a coincidence.

312
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,380
I love flowers.

313
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,080
I love flowers too. What a coincidence.

314
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,500
Madame Courtois is Mireille's godmother. Look.

315
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,740
This is Mireille's baptism.

316
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,220
Here's Mireille, this is the baby

317
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,960
And here is Mireille's mother

318
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,300
And that's Mireille's godmother

319
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,520
This is Madame Courtois, Mireille's godmother

320
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,540
Mireille has a father and a mother

321
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,540
And then, since she was baptized in the Catholic Church

322
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,040
She also has a godfather and a godmother

323
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,360
Mrs. Courtois and Mireille's mother

324
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,540
studied medicine together

325
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,720
They studied medicine

326
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,840
These are people who are studying medicine.

327
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,300
Here's a doctor.

328
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,740
To become a doctor, you have to study medicine.

329
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,460
A doctor, a person, medicine, science, the profession.

330
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,580
Mireille's grandfather was a surgeon, a doctor specializing in surgery.

331
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,060
A surgeon, a person, surgery, science, the profession.

332
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,880
Mireille does karate because it might be useful.

333
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,000
It can be useful. Of course, karate isn't useful every day.

334
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,540
But it might come in handy someday, you never know.

335
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,780
You never know what might happen. You never know what might be useful.

336
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,780
It might come in handy, you never know, as my Aunt Georgette says.

337
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,460
You never know. Look, observe this little scene.

338
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,400
Here, take your sweater.

339
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,420
But it's not cold.

340
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,740
It doesn't matter. Take it anyway, you never know. Go ahead.

341
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,680
Today, Marie-Laure is not at school.

342
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,520
What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at school?

343
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,960
No, that's not right, it's Wednesday today!

344
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,100
Marie-Laure is not at school because it's Wednesday.

345
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,800
There is no school on Wednesdays.

346
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,640
There is school on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday morning.

347
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,160
But not on Wednesdays, nor on Sundays

348
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,580
These are the days of the week

349
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:46,060
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

350
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,320
On Sundays, we go to church if we are Catholic, or to the temple if we are Protestant.

351
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,060
On Mondays, we work.

352
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,680
There is no school on Wednesdays.

353
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,640
We work on Thursdays and Fridays.

354
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,280
Saturday is the weekend.

355
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,900
On Saturdays, we go to the synagogue, if we are Jewish.

356
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,900
Well, that's all very good.

357
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,920
Now you are going to speak French.

358
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,880
Listen to the dialogue between Marie-Laure and Robert.

359
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,820
You will repeat Robert's answers.

360
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:21,600
Listen carefully, you're Mireille's boyfriend, you're English, why do I look English?

361
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:29,940
So what, I'm American now? You're Robert, you're the boyfriend.

362
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:37,500
Mireille, you're English, why do I look English? Why do I look English?

363
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:49,020
Why do I look English when what am I?

364
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:58,260
So, what do you know about me? I'm American. Let's see what you know if you want to send a...

365
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:05,760
For a postcard or a letter, you need a stamp, that's it, and then you need to find a

366
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,380
One, one, one, a mailbox.

367
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,960
You have one there, on the left.

368
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,040
Yes, the mailbox is on the left, but the cafe is on the right.

369
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,800
What do you see there? Something or someone?

370
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,940
Something.

371
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,560
And there? Someone.

372
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
Look at Mrs. Belleau here. Is she in the office?

373
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,900
No. Where is she?

374
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,940
At home. She is at home.

375
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,420
What is this garden? Do you recognize it?

376
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,920
This is the Luxembourg Garden.

377
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,900
Where is Marie-Laure? Is she at home?

378
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,300
No. Where is she?

379
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,680
In Luxembourg.

380
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,460
She is in Luxembourg.

381
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,500
That's French money.

382
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,260
How much is the bill worth?

383
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,120
It's a 500 franc note.

384
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,240
Look at these two young women. They're studying medicine because they want to be...

385
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,300
What do they want to be? They want to be doctors.

386
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,180
Robert's grandparents always gave him about a hundred dollars at Christmas and also for his birthday.

387
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,120
$100, $100 for his birthday. Well, do you get $100 for your birthday?

388
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,460
Nobody ever gives me $100 for my birthday. Never, it never happens to me, $100.

389
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,440
Tell me, do you think he's good, Sir Robert?

390
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
Not me.

391
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,360
But don't say anything, I think I can hear it.

392
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,260
I'll go see.

393
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,240
Ah, my stick!

394
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,040
It might come in handy, you never know.

395
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:32,460
