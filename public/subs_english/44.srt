Subtitles ST' 501

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,320
and absorb it.

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,740
Very soon, you will see what happens

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,200
and you will be able to say a few things in French yourself.

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,700
Mireille tells Hubert that she won the lottery.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,960
He is strongly disliked by the lottery.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,180
despite the fact that he was known for gambling on horses.

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,720
Robert and a shoe salesman have a problem with sizes.

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,240
And Ante Georgette tells the story of the one who drifted away.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,400
Before going to meet Hubert, Mireille will take a stroll through Place Vendôme.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,300
She arrives at Angelina's place on Rue de Rivoli where Hubert is waiting for her for lunch.

12
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:49,000
You'll never guess, I'll give you a thousand guesses, since I'll never guess, tell me everything.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:05,720
We immediately won the lottery, which is what Robert and I, by Jove, it's a disgrace!

14
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,000
The lottery is one of the most immoral institutions of our sad era; there is no

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,540
The lottery and horse racing are worse, but what's so shameful about the lottery?

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
First, it discourages the key virtues of our capitalist society.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Work, the economy, savings.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And besides, it encourages laziness.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Instead of relying on their work, people now rely only on their luck.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They live in anticipation of Thursday morning.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I thought you were betting on the races at Longchamp, weren't you?

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not the same thing.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because I work to improve the knight race.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,120
Meanwhile, Robert bravely tries to do some shopping.

25
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,480
It's in the shoe department at La Samaritaine.

26
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,100
Are you looking for boots?

27
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,480
No, I would like shoes that I can wear for driving and for walking.

28
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,040
Something that is sturdy, but not too heavy.

29
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,380
What is your shoe size?

30
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,220
Comment ?

31
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,660
What size shoe do you wear?

32
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,360
Ah, I wear size 11.5.

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,560
You guys at 11.5, you're joking.

34
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,480
You wear at least a size 43. I'd even say a 44.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,520
I assure you, the last time I bought shoes,

36
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,780
It was in Boston this winter, it was 11.5.

37
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,840
Look, these are the ones I have on my feet.

38
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,080
Well, they had to be elastic.

39
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,760
They have grown since this winter.

40
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,560
From 11.5.

41
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,380
You're American, you don't devalue the dollar, but you've certainly devalued your shoe sizes.

42
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Sit down so I can take your measurements.

43
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,380
44, exactly. That's what I thought.

44
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,380
I don't make mistakes often, I have a good eye for it.

45
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,380
A compass in the eye?

46
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,380
Doesn't that bother you when taking measurements?

47
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,660
Mireille arrives at Aunt Georgette's, still very excited.

48
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:23,800
Good morning.

49
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,100
Oh!

50
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,840
So, what did your father tell me?

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,140
Did you win the lottery?

52
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,940
Yes !

53
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,440
Winning the national lottery, my dream.

54
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,420
Today, it's only for young people.

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,940
Well,

56
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,220
The old folks have nothing left but to die in their corner

57
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,900
or sort lentils.

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,280
Okay, wait, I'll help you.

59
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:55,320
Ah no, there, no.

60
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,160
Ah, it was Georges who liked them, the lentils.

61
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,240
Georges ?

62
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,500
No, not your cousin, no.

63
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,060
Georges.

64
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,300
His name was Georges de Pignorolle.

65
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,700
You didn't know him.

66
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,900
Your parents didn't like him, they didn't want to see him.

67
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,920
What a handsome man.

68
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,080
Tall, dark-haired, distinguished.

69
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,540
I met him one evening on the Boulevard des Italiens.

70
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,620
We had a coffee, we understood each other.

71
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,820
We wanted to open a dog grooming salon together.

72
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,260
We had pooled our savings to buy a very good store.

73
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,540
Your father disagreed.

74
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,320
He was very unpleasant to Georges.

75
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,540
Georges couldn't stand it.

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,400
He left.

77
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,500
I never saw him again.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,540
So, tell me, how much did you win in the lottery?

79
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,660
40 000 francs ?

80
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,360
What are you going to do with all that money?

81
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,080
I don't know.

82
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,000
I called Cécile earlier to tell her the news.

83
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,300
She advises me to keep the money for when I get married.

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,620
Her husband says I should buy some land.

85
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,180
But he says it's the safest investment.

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,280
Dad would like me to buy paintings that will be worth millions in ten years.

87
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,880
And what do you advise me to do?

88
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,640
Yeah, for me, it's all very selfish.

89
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,340
If I were you, I would make a donation to the animal shelter.

90
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,640
At the animal shelter, what is this?

91
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,460
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, let's see.

92
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,660
And then, you could help me with my dog ​​cemetery.

93
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,120
Right, Fido?

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:56,620
Do you want mountain boots?

95
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,140
No, I'm afraid it will be too heavy.

96
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,420
However, for walking, high-top shoes would be better, not low-top shoes.

97
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,100
This is what you need.

98
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,100
These are high-top shoes; they provide excellent ankle support.

99
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
But it's very flexible, very light.

100
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
You have non-slip seats.

101
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
With this, you can't slip.

102
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Try them, you'll see.

103
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
How do they look on you?

104
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,560
Not bad, but the one on the left is a bit useful to me.

105
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,500
Oh, it's nothing, you get used to it.

106
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,460
How much are they worth?

107
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,700
450 francs.

108
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,920
The one on the right is really very good, but the one on the left is really useful to me.

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,100
And if I only took the one on the right, how much would it be?

110
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,820
450 francs, I'm sorry sir, but we don't sell them separately.

111
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,100
Really ?

112
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,520
Okay, so never mind, I'll take the pair.

113
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,220
The one on the right is really very good. I feel very comfortable there.

114
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,020
You don't need sandals, espadrilles, or slippers?

115
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,700
No, thank you. Not today.

116
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,320
Mireille has something extraordinary to announce.

117
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,420
It's so unexpected that she's sure Hubert will never guess.

118
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,960
Hubert, you'll never guess. I'll give you a thousand guesses.

119
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:50,320
I'll give you a thousand guesses. I bet you one to a thousand that you won't guess. I'll give you a thousand guesses.

120
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,680
We won the lottery.

121
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,000
Hubert doesn't like it. He's against the lottery.

122
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,780
It's a disgrace. The lottery is one of the most immoral institutions of our sad era.

123
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,640
Only the lottery and horse racing are worse.

124
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,440
The lottery is an immoral institution.

125
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,940
The lottery and the horse racing too

126
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,920
Lotto is a game, it's also a form of lottery.

127
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,820
And the tiercé is a bet on horse races

128
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,700
We're betting on three horses

129
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,640
According to Hubert, the lottery is immoral

130
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,720
That's not good

131
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:47,300
But the lottery, the horse races, that's even more immoral. It's worse. Six out of twenty has homework, that's not good. It's even bad. But two out of twenty is worse. Look at the traffic here. Bad. But here, it's worse.

132
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,400
Lotteries are immoral. Lotto and horse racing are even worse.

133
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,220
But only the lotto and the trifecta are worse than the lottery.

134
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,460
Only the lottery and horse racing are worse.

135
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,920
Listen to the dialogue between Mireille and Hubert. Then, you will play the role of Hubert.

136
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,680
Hubert, you'll never guess. I'll give you a thousand guesses.

137
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,740
Well, since I'll never guess, just tell me right now.

138
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,560
We won the lottery.

139
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,620
Who, us?

140
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,900
Robert and I, Pardy.

141
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,120
It's a disgrace.

142
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,900
Now it's your turn. Answer in Hubert's place.

143
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,940
Hubert, you'll never guess. I'll give you a thousand guesses.

144
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,660
Since I'll never guess, just tell me right now.

145
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,460
Since I'll never guess, just tell me right now.

146
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:48,800
Since I'll never guess, tell me right away.

147
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,820
We won the lottery

148
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,340
Who, us?

149
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,980
Who, us?

150
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,060
Who, us?

151
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,460
Robert and I, Pordy

152
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,360
It's a disgrace, it's a disgrace

153
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,800
It's a disgrace

154
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,160
The lottery is one of the most immoral institutions of our sad era.

155
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,960
Only the lottery and horse racing are worse.

156
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,760
This discourages the core virtues of our capitalist society.

157
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,660
Work, the economy, savings.

158
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,120
Work is generally considered a virtue.

159
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,460
Working is good.

160
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,140
Being hardworking is a quality.

161
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,720
Charity, too, is a virtue.

162
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,380
Courage, too, is a virtue.

163
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,360
In the Christian tradition, it is said that virtuous people go to heaven.

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,020
And those who are not virtuous will go to hell.

165
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,760
In a capitalist society, saving is considered a virtue.

166
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,960
You need to save money to build up capital.

167
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,780
It needs to be deposited in a bank or savings bank.

168
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,380
What would you do if you inherited a lot of money?

169
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,380
Okay, firstly, I would put a lot of money in the bank. In addition to that, I would save it for my wedding.

170
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
We save money.

171
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,440
If we had too much, we would already be putting some in the bank.

172
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,860
And you, sir?

173
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,740
Oh, the same thing, at the bank.

174
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
Are you running a savings promotion?

175
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,960
Ah, of course, we put it in the bank, we make that money work for us.

176
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,220
Well, I'll put it in the, what, bank.

177
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:24,440
Work, economy, and saving are the fundamental virtues of capitalist society.

178
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,460
Lotteries discourage work and encourage laziness.

179
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,960
He doesn't like to work, he's lazy.

180
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,560
Look, everyone else is working, but Guillaume isn't.

181
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,740
He's rather lazy. Laziness is not good.

182
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,240
We must not encourage laziness. No, we must discourage laziness.

183
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,840
Look here. The karate instructor is encouraging his student.

184
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,520
Here, the spectators are cheering on the cyclists.

185
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,320
But he is discouraged.

186
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,040
She too is discouraged.

187
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,840
The lottery discourages work

188
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,920
People don't work because they're waiting to win the lottery.

189
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,340
They are counting on their luck

190
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,360
And Marie-Laure is counting on Mireille to do her duty for her.

191
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,980
Hey, look, I don't understand anything, what do I need to put?

192
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,720
I'm not the one who's going to do your homework.

193
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,220
Don't rely on me, do it yourself.

194
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,420
Marie-Laure forgets everything, you can't count on her

195
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,960
Didn't you buy the bread?

196
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,780
I forgot

197
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,600
We really can't count on you

198
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,040
People who buy lottery tickets rely on their luck

199
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,160
They live in anticipation of Thursday morning.

200
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,600
Because the lottery draw takes place on Wednesday

201
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,100
And you can find the winning numbers in Thursday's newspaper.

202
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,960
The 307! The 307!

203
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,680
Hubert criticizes the lottery.

204
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,040
Yet, he plays the races.

205
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,940
He bets on horses.

206
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,200
More...

207
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,040
It's not the same thing.

208
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,860
People buy lottery tickets to win money.

209
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,800
That's selfish.

210
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,320
Hubert, on the other hand, does not play the races to win money.

211
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,380
He's doing it for a good cause.

212
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,460
Because I work to improve the horse breed.

213
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,240
He is working to improve the horse breed.

214
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,960
Meanwhile, Robert is trying to buy shoes

215
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,160
He doesn't want boots for horseback riding

216
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,620
He wants shoes for walking

217
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,980
If you want to buy shoes in a store

218
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,660
You can be sure that you will be asked

219
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,180
What is your shoe size?

220
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,780
Or

221
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,300
What size shoe do you wear?

222
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,420
But people don't always know their shoe size.

223
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,060
They don't always know their shoe size.

224
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,720
What is your shoe size?

225
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:04,980
Oh, I have no idea. The question comes up every time I go into a shoe store, maybe around size 41 or 42.

226
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:16,660
In the United States, Robert wears a size 11.5 shoe. In the American system, his shoe size is 11.5. But in the French system, 11.5 is a very small shoe size.

227
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:25,040
In fact, Robert has big feet. In the French system, he wears a size 44. That's a large shoe size.

228
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,600
So that's a size 44.

229
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,720
a small shoe size

230
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,360
a large shoe size

231
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,520
Robert insists

232
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,240
the last time he bought shoes

233
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
it was 11.5

234
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,540
Look, those are the ones I have on my feet.

235
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,740
Well, they must have been elastic.

236
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,400
they have grown since this winter

237
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,500
Robert's shoes

238
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,580
grew up

239
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,660
Robert used to be small

240
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,080
and now he is tall

241
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,400
Finally, it is bigger.

242
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,320
The big ones.

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,500
Robert's shoes must have grown, probably because they were elastic.

244
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,160
That's elastic. Of course, it's elastic.

245
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,800
The salesman takes Robert's measurements.

246
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,000
Sit down so I can take your measurements.

247
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,160
He measures Robert's foot. Robert wears exactly a size 44.

248
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,400
That's what the seller had said.

249
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,920
44, that's right, that's what I thought.

250
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,660
I'm not often wrong, I have a good eye for detail.

251
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,260
He has a good eye for detail.

252
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,900
A compass, a compass, for taking measurements

253
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:40,540
The seller doesn't need a compass because he has a compass in his eye.

254
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,100
Mireille also has a good eye for detail.

255
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
How much do you think that is?

256
00:16:47,100 --> 00:17:05,200
I'd say 83, between 83 and 85 cm, let's see 84, there you go, you have a good eye for it obviously

257
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:12,040
If you have a compass in your eye, it must be annoying even when you just have a tiny grain of dust.

258
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,880
A compass is bothered, but for him it's a fly that bothers him, and for him it's the

259
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:27,720
The light is bothering me, no, stop it, it's bothering me, it's the light that's bothering me

260
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Stop, I'm telling you it bothers me, I'll draw you a little picture, but be quiet.

261
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,260
Now these two aren't going to shut up anytime soon, what ill-mannered people there are!

262
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:52,820
Even if you talk in the cinema, it bothers others; here it's Mireille who's bothering Marie-Laure, here it's

263
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:01,100
Jean-Pierre, who's bothering Robert, what do you want now? You're not going to, it's you guys today.

264
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,300
Hello, it's kind of you to have come. I was just thinking about you.

265
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,220
Move aside, you can see you're in the way.

266
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,960
Mireille went to tell Aunt Georgette that she had won the lottery.

267
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,440
But Aunt Georgette already knew that.

268
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,240
So, what did your father tell me?

269
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,500
Did you win the lottery?

270
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:21,720
Yes.

271
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,460
Did you win the lottery? Ah, that doesn't surprise me.

272
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,900
Only young people have a chance there.

273
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,480
Everything is for young people. There's nothing but young people.

274
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,640
Hey, what is it now?

275
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,740
Can't you fix that for me?

276
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,960
I'm fed up. Mireille, fix this for me.

277
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,680
Mireille, do my homework for me.

278
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,560
Mireille, give me a taste. There's only some for you.

279
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,160
I have other things to do than take care of you.

280
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,580
Today, it's only for young people.

281
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,740
Today, it's all about young people.

282
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,300
Everything is for the young. Nothing for the old.

283
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,080
Old people have no choice but to die in their corner.

284
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,920
Nobody cares about the old people. They can just die.

285
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,520
What are you doing? You're crazy! Are you out of your mind? You're going to kill him!

286
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,360
Mind your own business!

287
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,760
Look, he's got a flat tire.

288
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,340
Old people have no choice but to die in their corner.

289
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,340
A corner. Aunt Georgette is sorting lentils.

290
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,240
Not that one.

291
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,640
No, not that one.

292
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:37,160
beans, split peas, lentils, sorting lentils, these lentils make it

293
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:44,240
thinking of a certain Georges who loved them so much, those Georges who...

294
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:54,120
He loved lentils; what a handsome, tall, dark-haired, distinguished man I had met on the boulevard.

295
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,960
We were Italians, we had a coffee, we understood each other, we wanted to go up together

296
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,480
a dog grooming salon; we had pooled our savings to buy

297
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,660
a very good shop a hair salon a hair salon a salon

298
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,480
Your father didn't agree with the dog grooming; he was very unpleasant.

299
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,920
Georges couldn't stand it, he left. Mireille called

300
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,660
I called Cécile earlier to tell her the news.

301
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,180
to tell him the news, the news of course being that she has

302
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,360
won the lottery, Aunt Georgette, you know the news

303
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,700
Mireille won the lottery, you know, the new Mireille has a new

304
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,300
My boyfriend's name is Robert, he's American, Cécile's husband, and she advises...

305
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:56,580
Mireille wanted to buy a plot of land, a plot of land to build a house on. A plot of land

306
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,640
It's a good investment because the value of the land increases. Paintings are also a good investment.

307
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:10,200
Good investment. Aunt Georgette thinks investing is selfish. But it's good.

308
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,540
It's all so selfish. Marie-Laure is selfish; she keeps all her chocolates for herself, she doesn't want

309
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:22,820
Not giving them to the children is selfish. You give me a chocolate, they're mine, you can have them.

310
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:29,760
Give me one, what a selfish Aunt Georgette is advising Mireille to give some

311
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,360
donate the money to the animal shelter (SPA) or give him money.

312
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,040
for his dog cemetery and then you could help me with my dog ​​cemetery, here's one

313
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:59,480
A cemetery, a cemetery in Paris, a Basque cemetery, a military cemetery in northern France, a marine cemetery, a cemetery, a car cemetery.

314
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,920
Aunt Georgette runs a dog cemetery.

315
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,920
And what is Robert doing in the meantime?

316
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,680
He's still trying to buy shoes.

317
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,340
Do you want mountain boots?

318
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,320
No, he doesn't want hiking boots. He's afraid they'll be too heavy.

319
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,480
However, for walking, he would prefer high-top shoes, not low-top shoes.

320
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,400
The salesman offers Robert some very flexible shoes.

321
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,440
That's not flexible. But that, yes, that's flexible.

322
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,760
These shoes are very flexible because the upper is made of canvas and the sole is made of rubber.

323
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,520
The sole isn't that thick.

324
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,840
No, it's not very thick, but it's very solid.

325
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,900
The soles of the patogases are quite thick.

326
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,860
These are non-slip soles.

327
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,340
You remember, skidding.

328
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,900
Warning, danger of skidding.

329
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,600
The car skids.

330
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,700
The cyclist skids.

331
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,120
He skids.

332
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,100
He too went off the rails.

333
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,560
He slipped. Him too.

334
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,240
But with non-slip soles, you can't slip.

335
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Robert tries on the shoes.

336
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,100
How do they look on you?

337
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,480
They suit her quite well.

338
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
The one on the right actually suits her very well.

339
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,100
Does this little black skirt suit you?

340
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,540
I think the other one suits you better.

341
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, does that look good on you?

342
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,500
Oh no, it's a change for you, but it suits you very well.

343
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:39,000
The shoe on the right fits him well, but the shoe on the left doesn't fit him so well.

344
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,340
She's squeezing it, it's too small.

345
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,640
It's tight.

346
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,560
He tightens the screws.

347
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,080
This shirt is tight.

348
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,100
Don't tighten it too much.

349
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,800
Pull in your stomach.

350
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,020
It's a greenhouse.

351
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,860
Do you remember sardines? They're packed tightly together.

352
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,960
And the people are packed in there too, packed like sardines.

353
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Robert would only want to take the right shoe, which fits him so well, and not take the left shoe, which is too tight.

354
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,780
But that's not possible.

355
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,260
Frankly, I'm sorry, sir, but we don't sell them separately.

356
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,600
Oh well. Robert will take the pair. Too bad. It's a shame.

357
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,640
So what do we do? What if they don't come?

358
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,320
Never mind, I won't start until everyone is here.

359
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,680
Robert takes the pair of Patogas.

360
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,680
You don't need sandals, espadrilles, or slippers?

361
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,200
Sandals, no. Robert doesn't need sandals.

362
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,920
Espadrilles, no. Robert doesn't need espadrilles.

363
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,520
Slippers, no. Robert doesn't need slippers.

364
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,500
No, thank you. Not today.

365
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,900
Now, observe, reflect, and speak.

366
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,100
6 out of 20 for an assignment is bad.

367
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,680
But 2 out of 20 is...

368
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,620
Worse.

369
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,540
Are courage and charity flaws or virtues?

370
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,060
Virtues.

371
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,620
Does the lottery encourage laziness or hard work?

372
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,020
Laziness.

373
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,880
Are these shoes for walking or for horseback riding?

374
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,180
For walking.

375
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,620
When you go to buy shoes in a store, what are they asking you?

376
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,600
What size shoe do you wear?

377
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,620
Look at Robert over there. What's he doing?

378
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,160
He grew up.

379
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,020
Is this elastic or rigid?

380
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,320
Elastic.

381
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,220
What is the seller doing?

382
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,440
He is taking action.

383
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
What happened to the goldfish?

384
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,000
He died.

385
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,960
Where does this young woman work?

386
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,060
In a hair salon.

387
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,580
Are these shoes rigid or flexible?

388
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,520
Flexible.

389
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,920
Is that the sole or the upper part of the shoe?

390
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,780
The sole.

391
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,600
Look at this woman. Is the jacket too big for her or is it too tight?

392
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,680
She squeezes it.

393
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Now you want to announce some extraordinary news to Mireille.

394
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
What do you tell him?

395
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Miss Mireille, you'll never guess!

396
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Since I'll never guess, tell me right now, Mr. Guignol!

397
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Well, I'm going to take a little nap, Miss Mireille!

398
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
You're a lazybones, Mr. Guignol!

399
00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:21,660
French subtitles?

400
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:50,680
