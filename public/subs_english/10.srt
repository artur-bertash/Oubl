00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,160
On May 28, a young man arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport.

4
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,100
His name is Robert.

5
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,020
He takes a taxi to go to Paris.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,000
...

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,820
He stays in a small hotel in the Latin Quarter, the Latin Man.

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,320
Now it's May 29th.

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,860
The two main characters in this fascinating story may meet.

10
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,900
It's a beautiful spring day, obviously.

11
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,900
And there's a student strike, obviously.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,280
Mireille has been studying at the Sorbonne for a year.

13
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,340
She is studying art history.

14
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,180
Right now, she just went out

15
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,640
of the Institute of Art and Archaeology

16
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,320
and she rests on a chair in the Luxembourg Gardens.

17
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,880
It is currently 10 AM.

18
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,780
Robert has been in Paris since yesterday.

19
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,880
He leaves his hotel.

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,320
He will explore the Latin Quarter.

21
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,620
A young man is walking in the Luxembourg Gardens.

22
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,980
He looks bored.

23
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,540
He notices a very pretty red skirt on a green chair

24
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,180
He approaches

25
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:43,400
The girl wearing the red skirt pretends not to see him

26
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,340
She looks up

27
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,600
They are very blue

28
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,080
His gaze drifts into contemplation of the sky, which is also very blue.

29
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
What beautiful weather, what a sky!

30
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
Not a cloud

31
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,160
Not a cirrus

32
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
Not a bigoted one

33
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,960
Not a stratus

34
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,840
Not a cumulus cloud

35
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,900
The weather is really beautiful

36
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,100
Don't you think so?

37
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,180
No response.

38
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,240
A little chilly perhaps, don't you think?

39
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
Finally, it's not really cold.

40
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,220
No, I'm not saying that, but it's less hot than yesterday.

41
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
Do you come here often?

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,420
I really like Luxembourg.

43
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,200
Even when the weather is bad.

44
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,760
Even in winter, under the snow.

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,740
In spring, when the chestnut trees are in bloom.

46
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:57,680
in summer when it's so pleasant in the shade near the Medici fountain in autumn

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,020
when you shovel up the dead leaves

48
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,640
You think I'm stupid?

49
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,540
You're not talkative, are you? I really like that. I don't like girls who

50
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,480
Don't talk to me too much. I'm not boring you.

51
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,620
You have a very pretty skirt.

52
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,960
Here, I'll tell you where it comes from. I'm never wrong.

53
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:46,720
So, these buttons, this pocket, that's from Dior.

54
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,620
Non ?

55
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,800
These buttons aren't from Dior?

56
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
Okay, so they come from FAT.

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,220
Non ?

58
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,300
So, from Saint Laurent?

59
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,500
Ah.

60
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,660
Okay, so, from Courrèges.

61
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,960
From Lanvin, Cardin, Givenchy.

62
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Presunique. I always get my clothes at Presunique.

63
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
She's gorgeous, though.

64
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Jean-Pierre.

65
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Jean-Pierre Bourdon.

66
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:45,300
Our story is very interesting, isn't it?

67
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,640
It's a fascinating story.

68
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,020
Look, here's a fascinating story.

69
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,220
This is a fascinating program.

70
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,100
And there you have it, a program that is not fascinating.

71
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,400
What a fascinating man!

72
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,420
And here is a lady who is fascinated.

73
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,220
In our fascinating story, there are two main characters, Mireille and Robert.

74
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:19,900
There are also less important characters, secondary characters, for example Georgette, Fido, Cécile.

75
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:30,420
Today, the two main characters of our story may, it's not certain, may meet.

76
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,280
Today, in history, is May 29th.

77
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,980
Present today, May 29th.

78
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,460
Passed yesterday, May 28th.

79
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,200
Future, tomorrow, May 30th.

80
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,100
Today is May 29th.

81
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,940
Yesterday was May 28th.

82
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,600
Tomorrow will be May 30th.

83
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,040
It's May.

84
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:07,560
May, April, June, that's spring. Spring. Summer, autumn, winter.

85
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,700
In spring, the trees are in bloom. That's spring.

86
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,560
In spring, the horse chestnut trees, the trees that produce chestnuts, are in bloom.

87
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,960
That's summer. That's summer too. And that's autumn.

88
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,560
In autumn, the leaves are yellow.

89
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,480
The dead leaves are falling

90
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,060
There are dead leaves everywhere

91
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,480
We shovel up the dead leaves.

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,200
Dead leaves and regrets too

93
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,040
What is gently stirring

94
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,820
And then, winter arrived.

95
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,020
That's winter.

96
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,480
In winter, there is snow

97
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,580
It's cold

98
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,680
In spring, it's less cold, it's nice.

99
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,100
In spring, it's nice and sunny.

100
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,200
It's hot in the summer.

101
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,960
In summer, it's pleasant in the shade.

102
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,440
In summer, it gets too hot in the sun.

103
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,140
And it's cooler in the shade.

104
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,480
There is plenty of shade near the Medici fountain.

105
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,100
Mireille likes the sun, but Madame Belleau prefers the shade

106
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,300
It's hot in the sun, it's cooler in the shade

107
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,760
In summer, it's hot, it's sunny

108
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,480
In autumn, it's less hot, it's cooler

109
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,260
In summer, in autumn

110
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,340
In winter, it is cold

111
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,700
It's snowing, it's raining

112
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,460
In summer

113
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,640
In autumn

114
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,140
In winter

115
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,080
In spring

116
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,160
It's warmer

117
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,880
The weather is nice

118
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,260
In summer

119
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,000
In autumn

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,600
In winter

121
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,380
In spring

122
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,240
In winter

123
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,140
It's cold

124
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,380
In spring

125
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,300
It's cool

126
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,600
In summer

127
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,560
It's hot

128
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,860
In summer

129
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,180
The weather is nice

130
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,440
In winter

131
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,240
The weather is bad

132
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,400
It's cold

133
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,380
It's cool

134
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,520
It's hot

135
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,440
The weather is nice

136
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,700
The weather is bad

137
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,900
Look. What season is this?

138
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,940
Is it spring or autumn?

139
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,740
It's spring.

140
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,380
Is it winter or summer now?

141
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,200
It's winter.

142
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,080
Is it autumn or spring now?

143
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,220
It's autumn.

144
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,800
Is this summer or winter?

145
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,660
It's summer.

146
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,700
And now, what's the weather like?

147
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,460
The weather is nice.

148
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,400
The weather is beautiful.

149
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,020
Ah, the weather is splendid, it's very beautiful today.

150
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,140
The weather here isn't nice, it's bad.

151
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,360
It's cold, it's hot

152
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,800
Now look, the weather isn't very nice, there are clouds

153
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,380
When the weather is very nice, there are no clouds.

154
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,020
There is sunshine here

155
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,440
It's windy here.

156
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:33,900
In winter, there is sometimes snow. Look, here there is snow, here there is wind, and here there is sun, but here there are clouds.

157
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:47,980
In the story, the weather is beautiful. It's a lovely spring day. The sun is shining, the sky is blue, there isn't a cloud in sight. The chestnut trees are in bloom, it's pleasant in the Luxembourg Gardens.

158
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:59,820
And there's a student strike. The students are on strike. The students are striking. The students aren't working. The students aren't studying.

159
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:22,540
They're not working to protest. They're on strike. There are strikes happening here. It's the workers who are on strike. Mireille is a student. She studies art history. She's studying art history. She's a student. She studies. She's studying.

160
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:37,520
She studies prehistoric art, Egyptian art, Greek art, medieval art, Renaissance art, classical art, 19th century art, and modern art.

161
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,640
Mireille has been a student for a year.

162
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,160
One year.

163
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,580
Robert has been in Paris since yesterday.

164
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,700
He has been in Paris since May 28th.

165
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:56,580
May 28, May 29, Robert is in Paris today, May 29, he has been in Paris since May 28.

166
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,720
Robert is in Paris today, May 29th, and he has been in Paris since May 28th.

167
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,400
He's been in Paris for a day.

168
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,780
He has been in Paris for one day, 24 hours.

169
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,060
Robert has been in Paris for 24 hours.

170
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,440
Mireille has been a student for a year.

171
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:36,520
Right now, Mireille isn't studying. She's sitting on a chair, resting. Ousmane is resting. Here, he works, he studies. And here, he rests. Mireille has been resting for five minutes. She's been resting on her chair for five minutes.

172
00:13:36,520 --> 00:14:00,660
She's just left the Institute of Art and Archaeology. There's the Institute of Art and Archaeology. And here's Mireille leaving the Institute. Here she is leaving her house. She's coming from her house and she's going to university. Here she is coming from university and she's going home.

173
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,780
Now, observe this carefully.

174
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,040
Right now, Mireille is in the Institute and she is going to leave.

175
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,940
Now she's going out.

176
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,280
And now, she's just come out.

177
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,120
She's going out.

178
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,400
She goes out.

179
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,520
It just came out.

180
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,280
Future, she will go out.

181
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,800
She is present, she leaves.

182
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,660
Past, she just came out.

183
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,500
Mireille has just left the institute and is resting on a chair.

184
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,100
It is 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock in the morning.

185
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,880
It's 10 o'clock here too, but it's 10 PM.

186
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
In the morning, in the evening.

187
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,700
In the morning, in the evening.

188
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,060
A young man is walking in the gardens.

189
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,500
Does he go to university? No.

190
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:15,060
Is he going to the movies? No. He's not going anywhere. He's taking a walk. Look at Robert here. He's taking a walk. That gentleman is taking a walk too. They're taking a walk too. That young man looks bored. He has nothing to do, so he's bored.

191
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,740
He notices Mireille. He approaches. He goes in Mireille's direction.

192
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,860
Here, it is Marie-Laure who approaches Mireille.

193
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:35,600
Mireille pretends not to see him. She sees him, she sees him, but she pretends not to see him.

194
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:43,520
Observe Marie-Laure here. She hears her mother. She hears her, but she pretends not to hear her.

195
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,260
Marie-Laure, do you work?

196
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,060
Marie-Laure pretends not to hear

197
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,200
And here, she will pretend to be asleep.

198
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,140
You'll see

199
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,900
She doesn't sleep

200
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,420
But she pretends to be asleep

201
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,560
Now, look at Mireille

202
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,760
She will look up

203
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,700
So

204
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,440
She looks up

205
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,600
Now she raises her head

206
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,120
Now she raises one arm

207
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:31,360
Now she lifts one leg. Mireille looks at the sky. She looks at the sky. Look at Mireille's gaze. Mireille's blue eyes are lost in the blue sky.

208
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,220
Look at Robert here. He's getting lost in the crowd.

209
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,020
Here, the road disappears into the vineyards.

210
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,580
Here, the peak disappears into the clouds.

211
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,340
Mireille's gaze drifts into contemplation of the sky.

212
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,220
Mireille gazes at the sky.

213
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,920
Here, Marie-Laure is gazing in contemplation at her new boat.

214
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,300
Here, Marie-Laure is contemplating a box of chocolates.

215
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,720
What beautiful weather, what a sky!

216
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,600
The young man becomes lyrical. He exclaims.

217
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:20,780
Ah, what weather, what beautiful weather, what a sky, what a beautiful sky, what a beautiful blue sky!

218
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,320
Listen to what Mireille says.

219
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,920
The sporty ones!

220
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,300
Now, observe this small scene.

221
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,740
"Hmm, what a beautiful dress! Is it new?"

222
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,460
"No, I've had it for a year."

223
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:50,240
"What beautiful weather! What a beautiful dress! What beautiful eyes! What a beautiful hand! What beautiful weather! What a beautiful dress! What beautiful eyes! What a beautiful hand!"

224
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,860
That's a lady who talks a lot. She's a chatty lady. She's a chatterbox.

225
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,840
She will be delighted by your acquaintance, and we will consider you unworthy.

226
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,240
What a chatterbox!

227
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,200
Yes, yes, yes!

228
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,320
Look at the young man, he's talkative.

229
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,380
Mireille isn't talkative, no. She doesn't say anything. It's the young man who's talkative.

230
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,020
He notices Mireille. He talks to her, but he doesn't know her.

231
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,460
He notices Mireille. He notices her.

232
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,840
She sees the young man, she sees him

233
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,620
He notices Mireille's eyes, he notices them

234
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:40,760
He finds Mireille pretty, he finds her pretty

235
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,480
Mireille doesn't find this young man interesting.

236
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,400
She doesn't find it amusing, she finds it boring.

237
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,920
This young man bores him

238
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,560
He bores Mireille, he is boring

239
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,660
He bores Mireille, he bores her.

240
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:06,240
Okay, let's get back to Mireille and this young man she doesn't know and who bores her.

241
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,460
So, these buttons, this pocket, that's from Dior.

242
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,640
A pocket

243
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
Nothing in my hands

244
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,140
Nothing in the pockets

245
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,880
Hands in pockets

246
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,820
Where are my gumballs?

247
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,060
Ah, in my pocket

248
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,680
And this is the revolver pocket

249
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,180
And this is a paperback book

250
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,560
A button

251
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,180
Buttons

252
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,760
A doorknob

253
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,640
A flower bud

254
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,220
She's very pretty though

255
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,980
What do you think of it?

256
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,700
She is lovely, very chic.

257
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,500
It's at least from Dior, or not really.

258
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,020
She's very chic, though.

259
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,160
Now, look at this scene.

260
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,080
Okay, come on, you're a nasty little girl, you're annoying.

261
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,480
But I still like you.

262
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,400
Stop, you're going to get sick.

263
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,520
I know, but oh well, I'll take another one anyway.

264
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,260
Mireille's skirt is from Prisunique

265
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,840
Prisunique, Monoprix, Uniprix – these aren't very chic stores.

266
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:34,300
That's a dress that might be from Dior.

267
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,340
Hmm, they are beautiful

268
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,260
Where do they come from?

269
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,040
That comes from our place

270
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,600
You see, I'm never wrong

271
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,060
Oh really? You never make a mistake? Well then, nine times nine?

272
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,720
Seventy-two.

273
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,360
Ha ha! You're mistaken, my dear. Nine times nine in eighty-one.

274
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,280
Are you sure?

275
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,680
Yes. I never make mistakes.

276
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,400
Look at that young girl. She's gone through the wrong door.

277
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,700
Look at this gentleman. He's picked up the wrong bottle.

278
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Everyone can make mistakes.

279
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,640
Of course Mireille makes mistakes sometimes.

280
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,800
But me, me, I never make mistakes.

281
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,440
It's professional.

282
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,980
You students make mistakes sometimes.

283
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,520
But I'm the teacher, I never make mistakes.

284
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,900
To be wrong.

285
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,880
Mireille is mistaken, you are mistaken, everyone is mistaken.

286
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,780
But I never make mistakes.

287
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,820
Now, pay close attention.

288
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,820
Look at Aunt Georgette here. What is she doing?

289
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,920
She's walking her dog. And what's that young man doing?

290
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,360
He is taking a walk.

291
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,260
Aunt Georgette is walking her dog, she's walking him,

292
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,740
and the young man goes for a walk.

293
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,340
Look at Marie-Laure here.

294
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,720
There, Marie-Laure looks at Mireille. She looks at her.

295
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:22,140
And here, is Marie-Laure looking at Mireille? No, she's looking at herself. And the gentleman in this drawing by Saint-Pé, what is he doing? He's looking at himself.

296
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:39,100
Let's take another example. Look at Mireille. She raises her arm, she raises her right leg, and now she stands up. She raises her arm, she raises it, and she stands up.

297
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,880
Look at Robert here.

298
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,400
He gets up.

299
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,380
Mireille gets up.

300
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,360
Look at Marie-Laure.

301
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,220
She dresses her doll.

302
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,920
Here, she gets dressed.

303
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,520
She dresses her doll, she dresses the doll, and she dresses herself.

304
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,400
Mireille says she gets her clothes at Prisunic.

305
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,000
She should buy all her clothes, dresses, skirts, and sweaters at Prisunic.

306
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,420
Prisunic. I always shop at Prisunic.

307
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,460
Finally, the young man introduces himself

308
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,180
Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Jean-Pierre, Jean-Pierre Bourdon

309
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,880
Look at this gentleman, he's going to introduce himself, his name is Jean-Pierre too

310
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,540
Allow me to introduce myself, Jean-Pierre Landru

311
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,680
My name is Mireille, Mireille Bello

312
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,600
What's your name ?

313
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,300
Marie-Laure

314
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,420
And you, what is your name?

315
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,420
My name is Colette, Colette Besson

316
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,420
And you, what is your name?

317
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,660
"My name is Pierre."

318
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,940
Okay, let's recap.

319
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,240
Look at this drawing of Saint-Pé.

320
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,540
What is this man doing?

321
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,300
He is taking a walk.

322
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,360
He notices something.

323
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,880
They are ants.

324
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,860
And there, he observes the ants.

325
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,640
He is gazing in contemplation at the ants.

326
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,820
He is lost in contemplation of the ants.

327
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,300
Now you are going to speak French.

328
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,260
Watch the meeting between Mireille and Jean-Pierre Bourdon.

329
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,220
You will repeat Jean-Pierre's answers.

330
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,860
What beautiful weather, what a sky, not a cloud in sight.

331
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,860
The weather is really beautiful. Don't you think?

332
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,340
Now it's your turn. Now, you are Jean-Pierre.

333
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:32,200
What beautiful weather, what beautiful weather, what a sky, not a cloud in sight.

334
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,240
What a sky! Not a cloud in sight.

335
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,520
The weather is really beautiful. Don't you think?

336
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,080
The weather is really beautiful. Don't you think?

337
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,960
Okay, now we're going to play a game.

338
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,440
Fun and useful for learning French.

339
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,840
What can we do?

340
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,000
You can go skiing.

341
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,760
Yes, you can go skiing. What else?

342
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,040
Water skiing.

343
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,380
You can go mountaineering.

344
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,220
Yes, you can go mountaineering, yes. What else?

345
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,660
You can go sailing.

346
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,240
You can go rock climbing.

347
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,040
We can study.

348
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,680
We can go on strike

349
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,420
We can take a nap

350
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,460
We can paint someone's portrait

351
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,860
One can be one meter seventy

352
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,800
Or one meter sixty-three like Mireille

353
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,080
We can pretend to be asleep

354
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,080
Okay, now what can he do?

355
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,840
The weather can be nice

356
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,160
The weather can be bad

357
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,480
It can get cold

358
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,640
It can get hot

359
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,160
Okay, we've been playing this silly game for an hour now.

360
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,900
It's starting to bore me.

361
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,880
Okay, that's enough.

362
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,220
We're going to take a nap.
