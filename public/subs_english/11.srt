Oh, damn bag!

Wait, madam, I'll help you.

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,800
It doesn't matter.

16
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,380
There you go.

17
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,700
Which way are you going?

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,120
Ah, yes.

19
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,880
I will accompany you.

20
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,500
Thank you, young man. You are very kind.

21
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,100

A young man is walking in the Luxembourg Gardens.

23
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,760
He looks bored.

24

26

She finds her little sister at home.

27
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,840
What are you doing here? Aren't you at school?

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,380
No, my throat hurts.

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
Hey, you've got some mail. A postcard.

30
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,120
Brickton, England, 25 mai.

31
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,120
My dear Mireille, the weather is dreadful.

32
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,520
There's fog every morning.

33
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,700
It rains every afternoon

34
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,260
Even when it's not raining, the sky is overcast.

35
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,460
You can't play tennis

36
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,140
But the lawn is magnificent

37
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,140
Bruce too, I send you my love, Guylaine

38
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,280
Where is Brickton?

39
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,140
Brighton, pas Brickton

40
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,120
Yes, where is it?

41
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,300
In England, of course.

42
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,520
Ah, and Bruce, what's this all about?

43
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,140
It's a name

44
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,740
A name for what?

45
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,340
From boy

46
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,400
De gazon ?

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,140
Are you a boy, deaf or just stupid?

48
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,140
Is it English?

49
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,200
Obviously

50
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Ah, and who is this Bruce?

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
He's Guylaine's boyfriend.

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Is he English?

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Well, yes, why not?

54
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Well, my little friends aren't English.

55
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
And why is the grass so beautiful?

56
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Because it's raining a lot.

57
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Does it rain all the time in England?

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Oh yes, just like in Brittany.

59
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Poor Guylaine.

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
I'll call him, then.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:35,280
Hello, hello Guylaine, is that you? It's me, Mireille. I just read your card. The weather isn't great.

62
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,920
So? Oh no, the weather's bad. What if it's nice? The weather's awful. The weather's

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:50,300
Magnificent. The sky is grey. The sky is blue. The weather is overcast. There isn't a cloud in the sky. It's raining.

64
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:58,320
It's sunny here. It's cold. It's hot. She catches rubs. She catches blows.

65
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,500
Sun. I'm going broke buying aspirin. I'm going broke buying sunscreen. And apart from that, how are you? Yeah, well,

66
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Yes, it's fine.

67
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
You too ?

68
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Yes, I'm fine.

69
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
When are you coming back?

70
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
The 2.

71
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Well then, soon then.

72
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Okay, kisses.

73
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I send you a kiss.

74
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Bye.

75
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Hello.

76
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Are you leaving?

77
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Yes.

78
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Where are you going?

79
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
At university.

80
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Do you have any English boyfriends at university?

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Mind your own business.

82
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:47,600
It is 10:40 AM

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,500
Robert continue son exploration

84
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,760
of the Latin Quarter

85
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:34,480
Subtitling by Radio-Canada

86
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:47,600
Robert discovers the Pantheon.

87
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,460
He sees a group of protesters coming from Soufflé Street.

88
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,400
They are shouting incomprehensible phrases.

89
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,340
They take Boulevard Saint-Michel

90
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,020
and head towards the Place de la Sorgol.

91
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,040
Robert stops a passerby.

92
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,540
What is it?

93
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,400
What's going on?

94
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,400
I don't know. Is it a protest?

95
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,800
A demonstration.

96
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Ah, this Robert.

97
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:44,680
and he follows the demonstrators, he enters with them into the courtyard of the Sorbonne

98
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,320
Meanwhile, Mireille arrives via the street of the schools

99
00:08:51,320 --> 00:09:12,980
She enters the Sorbonne, crosses the corridor, and stops to look at a notice board.

100
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,840
She passes under the arches

101
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,440
And is located in the courtyard

102
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,000
Robert is also in the courtyard

103
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,860
She comes very close to him

104
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,740
He immediately notices her elegant figure

105
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,440
She is wearing a rather short red skirt

106
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,160
And a rather tight-fitting white sweater

107
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,820
He finds his face pleasing

108
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,160
And he smiled at him

109
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,280
She looks at him with amusement and smiles back.

110
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:59,560
Who is the main character in this story?

111
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,740
Mireille or Robert?

112
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:00,980
Robert

113
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,140
Mireille

114
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,600
Do you think it's Mireille?

115
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
No, it's Robert

116
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,720
Let's say that in this story, there are two main characters

117
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,140
Mireille et Robert

118
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:19,040
There are secondary characters like Aunt Georgette, Hubert, Colette and two main characters, Mireille and Robert.

119
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,760
Robert, one of the main characters, explores the Latin Quarter.

120
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,100
Here's Robert, the explorer. He's off to explore the Latin Quarter.

121
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,180
While exploring the Latin Quarter, he encounters an old woman with an old bag.

122
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,140
Oh, damn bag!

123
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,000
A shopping bag.

124
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,860
A handbag. A backpack.

125
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,100
The old woman is carrying an old, damaged shopping bag.

126
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,020
Oh, damn bag! What a piece of junk!

127
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,600
Ah, what a mess!

128
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,500
Robert helps the old woman.

129
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,380
Here, Mireille is helping Marie-Laure.

130
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,620
But wait! I'll help you.

131
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,720
Can I help you, madam?

132
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,820
Oh, you're very kind.

133
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,560
Wait, madam, I'll help you.

134
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,820
It doesn't matter.

135
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,900
It's not serious.

136
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,740
Now, look at this.

137
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,300
It's not serious.

138
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,240
That's serious.

139
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,000
Look at this little girl crying.

140
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,800
This is serious.

141
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
Is it really that serious?

142
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,340
Very serious.

143
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,440
Very, very serious.

144
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,940
Look, that's not it either.

145
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,860
It's not serious.

146
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,340
The gentleman here is late.

147
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,940
But it's not a big deal.

148
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,920
Robert accompanies the old woman.

149
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,080
Here, a young girl offers to accompany an old lady.

150
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:11,900
Robert accompanies the old lady and she thanks him

151
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:25,560
Meanwhile, Mireille returns home.

152
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,860
There, she leaves her house

153
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,100
And here, she goes home.

154
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,980
She goes out, she comes back in

155
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,980
She goes out, goes out, she comes back in, comes back in.

156
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Look at Marie-Laure here, she's going to school.

157
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,460
Attention, school.

158
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,600
Marie-Laure is 10 years old, normally she goes to school, she goes to primary school.

159
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,500
But today, Marie-Laure is not at school.

160
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Isn't she at school?

161
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,940
She is not at school because she has a sore throat.

162
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,940
No, my throat hurts.

163
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,260
This little boy, however, has a stomachache.

164
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,640
And this gentleman has a sore hand. He hurt himself.

165
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,040
Yes. He hurt himself.

166
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,720
Marie-Laure, on the other hand, is in pain all over.

167
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,180
My head hurts. My neck hurts.

168
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,920
My throat hurts. My eyes hurt.

169
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,740
My fingers hurt. My leg hurts.

170
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,720
My ear hurts. My stomach hurts.

171
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,200
She has a headache, an earache, a stomachache, eye pain, and a toothache.

172
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,860
Look at poor Marie-Laure. Where does she hurt?

173
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:53,280
Her fingers hurt, her leg hurts, her stomach hurts, her eyes hurt, she has a headache.

174
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,380
There's mail for the children.

175
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
Marie-Laure, I have some mail for you.

176
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:07,000
Ah, so, letters, a postcard, leaflets, notes, a newspaper.

177
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,460
Hey, you've got some mail, a postcard.

178
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,400
This is a postcard from Guylaine, a friend of Mireille who is in England.

179
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,920
She says the weather isn't nice, it's awful.

180
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,280
The weather here is magnificent.

181
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
But the weather here is awful.

182
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,580
That's a hideous monster.

183
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:38,800
Here is a hideous beast, here is another hideous beast, and here is a hideous head, and here is hideous weather.

184
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,080
There is fog every morning.

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,360
Look, what is it? Fog.

186
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,200
There's fog here too. There's often fog in England.

187
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,900
It rains every afternoon.

188
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:03,280
In the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening, at night.

189
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,380
The sky is overcast.

190
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,780
There are clouds. The weather is overcast. The sky is overcast.

191
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,860
But the lawn is magnificent.

192
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,600
And why is the grass so beautiful?

193
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,640
Because it's raining a lot.

194
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,040
In England, the grass is magnificent because it rains a lot.

195
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,420
And because the English take great care of their lawns.

196
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,140
Does it rain often in England?

197
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,180
Not all the time, no. But often.

198
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,360
In England, it rains all the time. And there's often fog.

199
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,860
It's true ?

200
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,520
Yes, finally. The French say so. Look.

201
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,000
What do you think the weather is generally like in England?

202
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,280
Pretty bad. It's raining, it's foggy.

203
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,420
In England, there is mist and fog. The weather is not very nice.

204
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,560
Now you are going to speak French

205
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,140
Listen to this dialogue between Mireille and Guylaine

206
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,180
You will repeat Mireille's answers

207
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,480
The sky is grey

208
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,780
The sky is blue

209
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,280
It's raining

210
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,620
It's sunny here

211
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,020
It's cold

212
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,440
It's hot

213
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,080
Now it's your turn, you are Mireille

214
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,580
The sky is grey

215
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,940
The sky is blue

216
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,000
The sky is blue

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,680
Now it's your turn.

218
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,520
The sky is blue

219
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,000
It's raining

220
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
It's sunny here

221
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,920
It's sunny here

222
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,720
Now it's your turn.

223
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,020
It's sunny here.

224
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,380
It's cold.

225
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,740
It's hot.

226
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,940
It's hot.

227
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,880
Now it's your turn.

228
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,820
It's hot.

229
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,280
Very well. Now, let's get back to Mireille and Marie-Laure.

230
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,740
The lawn is magnificent.

231
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,580
Bruce too.

232
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,360
Who is this Bruce?

233
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
He's Guylaine's boyfriend.

234
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,920
And he's English?

235
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,520
Of course, he is English.

236
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Why not ?

237
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,760
Do you have any English boyfriends at university?

238
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,960
Mind your own business.

239
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,020
Mireille doesn't like people interfering in her affairs.

240
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,800
Mind your own business.

241
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,080
Who are you writing to? Your boyfriend?

242
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,420
Mind your own business.

243
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,200
Here, take care of your doll and leave me alone.

244
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,160
Marie-Laure also doesn't like people interfering in her affairs.

245
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,200
Are you working? Mind your own business.

246
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,440
But she enjoys taking care of her doll.

247
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,440
What are you doing ?

248
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm taking care of my doll

249
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,480
Oh, you're taking care of your doll

250
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,960
Yes, I'm taking care of my doll, so what?

251
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,980
She is taking care of her doll

252
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,960
Are you taking care of your doll?

253
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,360
Yes, I'm taking care of my doll

254
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,500
She is taking care of her doll

255
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,280
Here, take care of your doll

256
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,280
Are you taking care of your doll?

257
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,220
"Take care of your doll. Look at Marie-Laure now."

258
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,020
"Marie-Laure, get up."

259
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,580
" Yeah ! "

260
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,360
"Well, are you getting up?"

261
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,020
"Yeah, I'm getting up!"

262
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,780
"Come on, get up!"

263
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,600
There are people who don't like getting up.

264
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,760
"But get up, it's already noon!"

265
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,620
"Oh, shut up, will you let me sleep in peace!"

266
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,140
"Are you getting up? Get up."

267
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,120
Mireille calls Guylaine on the phone.

268
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,680
Marie-Laure!

269
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,220
Mrs. Bello calls Marie-Laure.

270
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,880
It's the verb "to call".

271
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,340
They call their friends.

272
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,700
I think they're calling you.

273
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,580
He calls too.

274
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,600
Cle, Leva, Paul!

275
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,740
He calls his children.

276
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,180
To call.

277
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,820
She calls, I call, you call, they call, we call, you call.

278
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,040
She catches colds

279
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,220
The little boy catches the ball

280
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:58,060
The rugby player catches the ball

281
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,960
Look at Marie-Laure here

282
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,360
Oh my god, look at that!

283
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,020
Come on, go home, we'll change you

284
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,900
But you'll catch a cold.

285
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,500
She has a cold.

286
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,660
She caught a cold.

287
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,520
You can catch a cold, you can get sunburned.

288
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,200
Be careful, you're going to get sunburned.

289
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,960
Here, put on some sunscreen.

290
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,660
23 francs, 46, 69, 92, 115 francs.

291
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,440
I'm spending a fortune on sunscreen oil.

292
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,840
50.

293
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,500
You're going to ruin yourself, sir.

294
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,660
Yes, I'm spending a fortune on postcards.

295
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
Are you leaving?

296
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Yes.

297
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,660
Mireille leaves, Mireille returns.

298
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Mireille leaves, Mireille returns.

299
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,660
Mireille leaves, Mireille returns.

300
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,660
Marie-Laure leaves, Marie-Laure returns.

301
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,400
I'll be right back.

302
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,820
He's leaving, but he'll be back right away.

303
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,520
And there he is again.

304
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,400
Mireille enters the Sorbonne.

305
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,440
Mireille is leaving the Sorbonne.

306
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,160
Mireille enters the classroom.

307
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,060
Mireille leaves the classroom.

308
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,120
She enters the classroom.

309
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,080
She leaves the classroom.

310
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,100
She enters the classroom.

311
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,060
She leaves the classroom.

312
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,200
She leaves her house.

313
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,340
She goes home. She leaves her house. She goes home.

314
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,860
To go out. She leaves her house. He leaves his house. I leave my house.

315
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,320
Are you leaving your house? We're leaving our house. Are you leaving your house?

316
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,240
They leave their homes.

317
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,860
Mireille takes the street of schools. The protesters take the boulevard Saint-Michel.

318
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,720
She takes. They take. It's the verb "to take".

319
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,000
Now they are taking Boulevard Saint-Michel.

320
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,180
That's a street, the street of schools.

321
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,320
That's a boulevard, Saint-Michel Boulevard.

322
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,760
That's an avenue, General Leclerc Avenue.

323
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,180
That's a square, Place Saint-Sulpice.

324
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,000
Robert stops a passerby.

325
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,240
Mireille stops.

326
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,160
Robert stops a passerby.

327
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,900
Mireille stops.

328
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,020
The protesters are shouting.

329
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,540
Look at this man, he's going to scream.

330
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,180
I'm being pushed!

331
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,360
She screams.

332
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,260
They are shouting too.

333
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,640
So, you start shouting, you get angry, you get angry, you shout.

334
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,780
He is calm, but he is shouting.

335
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,500
So I'm calm and I'm listening to you!

336
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,760
The protesters are also shouting.

337
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,740
They are shouting incomprehensible phrases.

338
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,640
The protesters are shouting is a phrase.

339
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,800
"He shouts" is a sentence, but "he" is not a sentence, it's a word.

340
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,840
"Scream" is not a sentence, it's a word, a verb.

341
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,580
Robert doesn't understand the phrases the protesters are shouting.

342
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,420
These are incomprehensible sentences.

343
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,440
She too is shouting incomprehensible phrases.

344
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,380
Robert is following the protesters.

345
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,660
And I am Robert.

346
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,740
No, I am Robert.

347
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,100
Yes, you are Robert and I am following you.

348
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,400
Come on, come on, follow the protesters.

349
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,500
I am Robert, he follows Robert, that's the verb to follow.

350
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,080
I am Robert, he is Robert, it's the verb to be.

351
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,440
I am Robert, he follows Robert, he follows the protesters, follow the protesters.

352
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:27,540
He follows Mireille. He follows a young girl. He follows a gentleman. He too follows a gentleman. He follows a young woman. Follow the guide. You must follow the guide. Follow me. Follow the arrow. You must always follow the arrows. You must always follow the arrows.

353
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,420
Mireille arrives at the Sorbonne via the school street

354
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,560
She enters the Sorbonne, crosses the corridor

355
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,140
Stops to look at a notice board

356
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,140
The corridor, the courtyard, a notice board

357
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,420
That's an Ingres painting

358
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:51,060
A blackboard, a dashboard, a display board

359
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,880
Mireille is in the courtyard of the Sorbonne

360
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,400
Robert is also in the courtyard of the Sorbonne

361
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,000
He gets very close to her, and immediately notices her elegant figure.

362
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,540
There you have it, an elegant silhouette.

363
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,340
A less elegant silhouette.

364
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,000
Look at Jean-Claude here, he's elegant.

365
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,120
Mireille is wearing a rather tight-fitting white sweater.

366
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,360
Here, she is wearing a white sweater that is not at all clingy.

367
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,780
She is wearing a red skirt.

368
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,480
Here, she is wearing jeans.

369
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
Marie-Laure is wearing jeans.

370
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
She also carries her boat.

371
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,280
Here, she is carrying plates.

372
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,620
The old woman is carrying a bag.

373
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Robert finds Mireille's face pleasant.

374
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,800
A pleasant face.

375
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,080
A less pleasant face.

376
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,720
Robert smiled at Mireille.

377
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,120
He smiled at her.

378
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,400
He smiled.

379
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,160
The Mona Lisa is smiling.

380
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,340
Look at this man.

381
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,160
The photographer says, "Smile, smile."

382
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,600
But he didn't smile.

383
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,080
Now he's smiling.

384
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:16,660
And this gentleman, he doesn't smile. The woman tells him to smile, smile, but he doesn't smile. Robert smiles at Mireille. Robert smiles. Mireille smiles back. She smiles back at Robert. It's the verb "to smile back." Observe.

385
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,660
Hey, give me back my gumballs!

386
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,720
Give me back my gumballs!

387
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,600
Yes, I'll give them back to you.

388
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,660
Give them back to me right now!

389
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,700
Here, here are your gumballs, I'm giving them back to you.

390
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,680
Mireille returns her gumballs to Marie-Laure.

391
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,600
She gives them back to him.

392
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,880
Okay, let's see what you have to say now.

393
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,660
Is Robert a minor character in our story?

394
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,660
No, he's a main character.

395
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:47,900
Alright.

396
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,160
What is Mireille doing here?

397
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,580
She leaves her house.

398
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,200
And then she goes home.

399
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,560
Look at Marie-Laure.

400
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,940
Where does it hurt?

401
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,660
Her leg hurts.

402
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
At the head.

403
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,940
In the eyes.

404
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,920
What is this man doing?

405
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,480
He calls.

406
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,720
And what is this young girl doing?

407
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,400
She smiled.

408
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,820
And what is Jean-Claude doing here?

409
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,900
He follows Robert.

410
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,840
I have gumballs, I have gumballs, you don't.

411
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,200
Oh, I'm being followed, I think someone is following me.

412
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,260
Who is following me?

413
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,540
Who could possibly be following me?

414
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,840
Why are you following me?

415
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,880
Hey, my gumballs, give me back my gumballs, give them back to me.

416
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Would you please give me back my gumballs?
