00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,580
Indeed, shortly afterwards, Robert emerges onto the rue de Vosgirard.

5
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,500
52.

6
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,740
It must be this way.

7
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,720
54 ?

8
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,860
No, then it's not here.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,960
46, 28, 12

10
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,240
But where is the 18th?

11
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,260
There is no 18, it doesn't exist.

12
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,580
Well, well, could Mireille have given me a fake number?

13
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,940
No, there it is, 18 is here

14
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,020
It is a fairly old building, with five floors, and a sixth floor under the roof.

15
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,380
Near the front door, there is a button and a small sign that says "Ring and enter".

16
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,540
Robert presses the button, pushes the door open and enters.

17
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,800
The light went out immediately.

18
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,540
The vestibule is dark and smells like cat pee.

19
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,080
Robert is looking for a list of tenants

20
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,100
There aren't any.

21
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,520
He thought to himself that he should have asked Mireille which floor she lived on.

22
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,140
That would have been simpler

23
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,820
On the glass door of the concierge's lodge

24
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,960
There's a sign that says hit hard

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,540
Robert hits

26
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,200
No effect

27
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,720
He hits harder

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
Yes, what is it?

29
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,820
Bello, please.

30
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,700
Georgette Bello, on the fifth floor at the back of the courtyard.

31
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,220
No, Mr. and Mrs. Bello.

32
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,880
Ah, they live on the fourth floor, right.

33
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,420
Take the stairs opposite, the elevator isn't working.

34
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:51,120
The elevator is small and looks fragile

35
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,700
Even if he had walked, Robert would probably have preferred to go up on foot.

36
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,740
At the foot of the stairs, on the ground floor, a small sign orders

37
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,080
"Wipe your feet"

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,820
Robert obeyed, he wiped his feet

39
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:13,560
Having reached the fourth-floor landing, he notices near the right-hand door

40
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,500
A small business card that says

41
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,240
Mr. François Bello, engineer and captain

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,660
He gives a discreet ring to the doorbell

43
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,820
A smiling young girl opens

44
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,540
This is not Mireille

45
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,740
Ah, excuse me, I must have made a mistake

46
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,000
I... I was looking for the Bello

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,380
This is the right place, you haven't made a mistake.

48
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,920
You must be Mr. Taylor, no doubt. I'm Colette Besson, a friend of Mireille's. Come in.

49
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:55,960
In the entrance hall, Robert notices a large vase with half a dozen roses reflected in a mirror, happily completing the dozen.

50
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,160
It's the American!

51
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Come on Marie-Laure, you need to be polite, what's with these manners?

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,860
That's my beloved cowboy. Hi, cowboy. Where did you leave your horse?

53
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,420
I tied him up in the garden downstairs.

54
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,480
You did the right thing, because we don't have any space here.

55
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,920
And you know, we're not really used to receiving cowboys with horses.

56
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,860
If you would be so kind as to sit down for a moment in the living room, I will inform Mrs. Bello.

57
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,160
The room Robert is in is a fairly large living room

58
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,320
which connects to the dining room, where the table is already set for this meal.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,380
A sofa, a few chairs, Louis XVI and Second Empire armchairs, a piano, and on the wall, two or three modern paintings.

60
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,280
Madame Bellou enters

61
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,760
I am delighted to meet you

62
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,140
Madame

63
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,020
The Courtois have told us a lot about you

64
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,040
Mr. Bellou's follow-up

65
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,320
Marie-Laure, very happy to meet you

66
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,660
Sir

67
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,940
Hello Robert, how are you? I see you've already met my parents

68
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,140
Marie-Laure, please turn off the TV.

69
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,540
It's the weather report. And Robert, quite astonished, recognizes the presenter.

70
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,700
But I know this gentleman.

71
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,140
Really ?

72
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,600
Not possible.

73
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,640
No kidding.

74
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,840
Do you know Alain Gilopétré? Since when?

75
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,080
Just now. I met him in the street. I was a little lost. He pointed me towards Rue de Vaugirard.

76
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,240
And how long ago did you last see it?

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,160
No, just now. Maybe half an hour ago.

78
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,860
Well, he made it to the studio in a hurry.

79
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,440
Oh yeah?

80
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,260
He seemed to be in a hurry.

81
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,780
And did you talk to him?

82
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,120
Yes.

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,060
He might talk about you, an American cowboy lost in the streets of Paris.

84
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,120
Marie-Laure, you are unbearable.

85
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,320
Titoudon, it's very hot in here.

86
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,220
Let's go out onto the balcony for a moment, I'll show you the view.

87
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,320
An unobstructed view, as you can see, with the Luxembourg Gardens right in front.

88
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,160
There, the Senate, naturally.

89
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,920
Over there on the left is the Pantheon.

90
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,640
And on the right, over there, alas, the Montparnasse tower.

91
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,240
58 floors. A horror, a catastrophe.

92
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,060
It can be seen from all over Paris.

93
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,400
And the Eiffel Tower, we can't see it?

94
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,000
No, not from here. It's further to the right.

95
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
It can be seen from the rooms that overlook the courtyard.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,140
Come, Mr. Taylor.

97
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:40,620
So, this is our bedroom, there's the bathroom, but we can't see the Eiffel Tower from here, we can't see the tops of the rooms that are on this side overlooking the courtyard.

98
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:50,260
Mr. Bello and Robert return to the living room

99
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,940
You have a really beautiful apartment.

100
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,900
Passing by the kitchen

101
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,180
Well, it looks like everyone's in the kitchen

102
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,820
We really like this apartment.

103
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,400
We were already living here when Mireille was born

104
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,580
It is very well situated in full sun, and there is plenty of sunshine.

105
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,380
Excuse me for a minute, I'm going to prepare the appetizers.

106
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,120
Robert and Mireille are alone on the balcony for a moment.

107
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,580
It's true that you have a magnificent view.

108
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,180
Yes.

109
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,720
Hey, I wanted to tell you, my parents have invited a friend of mine, Hubert de Pinochambra.

110
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,540
He is a childhood friend, and he comes from a very aristocratic family.

111
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:38,460
And he's always talking about his family, his ancestors, their hunting, their horses, their castle.

112
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,320
The family owns a large construction company.

113
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,000
But you shouldn't take him too seriously because, in fact, he's just playing.

114
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,900
And he plays his role as a great aristocrat remarkably well.

115
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,920
He's a funny guy, you'll see.

116
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,100
It's very funny.

117
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,600
Personally, I find it amusing.

118
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,180
He amuses me greatly.

119
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,900
Hey, that must be him.

120
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,620
You may have noticed that Robert often gets lost

121
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,340
So he is forced to ask for directions

122
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,880
For example, when he went to the Courtois' place, he ended up at the Defense

123
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,320
Miss, please, the Totem Tower

124
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,560
I don't know, you're in La Défense here, it's not this way, I don't think so.

125
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,160
He takes the metro again and a quarter of an hour later, he finds himself in Montmartre.

126
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,540
"Excuse me, the Quai de Grenelle, please. The Totem Tower is this way."

127
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,320
"The Quai de Grenelle, but that's in the 15th arrondissement. Here, you're in Montmartre."

128
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,660
Here, he wants to go to Provins and he asks where Fontainebleau is.

129
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,760
"To get to Fontainebleau, it's this way."

130
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,460
"Yes, go back up Boulevard Raspail, right there in front of you."

131
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,500
And three hours later, he finds himself in the heart of Burgundy.

132
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,840
"Excuse me, sir, Paris is that way."

133
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,380
Today, he has to go to the Bélots' house. He got lost again.

134
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,280
Don't follow him, he's lost.

135
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,540
He meets a man and asks him for directions.

136
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,900
Excuse me sir, excuse me, I'm a little lost.

137
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,220
Vougira Street, please.

138
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,740
It's this way, that was the side. Is it that way?

139
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,560
No, it's this way, it's not far, you're almost there.

140
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,700
A few minutes later, at the Bélots' house, he sees this gentleman on television.

141
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,280
So 17 degrees in Perpignan, we are 4, 5 degrees above huge seasonal averages, we don't understand anything anymore.

142
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,240
But I know him, sir.

143
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,880
Really ?

144
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,720
Alain-Gillot Pétret is the one who gives the weather report.

145
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,460
What a coincidence!

146
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,000
Robert eventually made it to the Bélots' place, but it was a difficult journey.

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,120
He eventually found the rue de Vaugirard, but he couldn't find number 18.

148
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,820
Finally, he found it.

149
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:58,280
It is a late 19th-century building with five or six floors.

150
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,120
It's that building at number 2. Second floor, door on the left.

151
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:14,040
In the center of Paris, most buildings have five or six floors, except for the Montparnasse tower which has 58 floors.

152
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:24,260
The ground floor, the first floor, the second floor, the third floor

153
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,460
The fourth floor, the fifth floor, under the roof

154
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,120
Roofs, roofs

155
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,120
The rooftops of Paris

156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,140
So Robert finally found the Bélots' house.

157
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:47,080
There is a large door, he rings the bell, presses the button and pushes the door open.

158
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,340
The moment he enters, the light goes out.

159
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,980
She turns it off, she turns it on.

160
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,160
The lights turn on, the lights turn off.

161
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,760
Here the headlights are on and here they are off.

162
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,140
You can also light or extinguish a fire, a cigarette, the TV.

163
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,580
Put out your cigarette, old man.

164
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,780
Marie-Laure, please turn off the TV.

165
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,800
Turn off.

166
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,620
Turn it off!

167
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,760
Turn it off!

168
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,660
Turn off everything.

169
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,700
And here, we turn it on.

170
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,360
You can turn it on.

171
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,000
No, stop, it's bothering me.

172
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,240
He turns it off.

173
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,140
It turns on.

174
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,300
Stop, I'm telling you it bothers me.

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,500
He turns it off.

176
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,340
He turns it back on.

177
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Robert doesn't know which floor Mireille lives on.

178
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,880
So he looks for the concierge to ask her.

179
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,000
He strikes.

180
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,520
No effect.

181
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,840
No one comes, no one answers.

182
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,440
He hits harder.

183
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,440
Yes, what is it?

184
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Enter.

185
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,280
Bello, please.

186
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,200
Georgette Bello, on the fifth floor at the back of the courtyard.

187
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,280
On the fifth floor at the back of the courtyard.

188
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,340
At the fifth, she means on the fifth floor.

189
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,180
Are the rooms on the first floor, sir?

190
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,700
Well...

191
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,680
Can you go, Dad?

192
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,580
Yes !

193
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,960
"Au premier" means on the first floor.

194
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,180
So, which floor is it on?

195
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,240
At the top, last.

196
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,380
Bello, please.

197
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,220
Georgette Bello, on the fifth floor, at the back of the courtyard.

198
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,640
She lives on the fifth floor, at the back of the courtyard.

199
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,120
Isn't your office at the back of the courtyard?

200
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,280
The courtyard? Now that's a courtyard.

201
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,680
An old courtyard.

202
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,660
A farmyard.

203
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,780
A schoolyard.

204
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,280
A courtyard.

205
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,800
Very often in Paris, buildings have an interior courtyard.

206
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,960
There are apartments facing the street and there are apartments facing the courtyard

207
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,180
An apartment facing the street, an apartment facing the courtyard

208
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,520
The Bélots' apartment is not on the courtyard, it's on the street

209
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,720
On the fourth floor, you need to take the stairs

210
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,520
The staircase, do you remember?

211
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,520
There is an elevator, but it is out of order.

212
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
There is an elevator there and it is not out of order.

213
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,960
Here's an elevator, a modern elevator.

214
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,520
The elevator in the bicycle section is older.

215
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,820
And on that day, it didn't work. It broke down.

216
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,840
The elevator breaks down here.

217
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,920
But what is it, sir?

218
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,840
I don't know. It's a breakdown.

219
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,940
Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic.

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,960
It's nothing, just a minor incident. We'll get you off the train.

221
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,100
But that's outrageous!

222
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,420
Above a certain room price, the elevators must not break down.

223
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,880
Listen to the short exchange between Robert and the concierge.

224
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,500
Then, you will answer Robert as if you were the concierge.

225
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,060
Bello, please.

226
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,740
Georgette Bello ?

227
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,000
On the fifth floor at the back of the courtyard.

228
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,500
No, Mr. and Mrs. Bello.

229
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,280
Ah, they live on the fourth floor, right.

230
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,180
Is there an elevator?

231
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,780
No, take the stairs opposite, the elevator is not working.

232
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,400
Now it's your turn. You're the concierge.

233
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,240
Bello, please.

234
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,940
Georgette Bello ?

235
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,160
On the fifth floor at the back of the courtyard.

236
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,540
Georgette Bello ?

237
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,840
On the fifth floor at the back of the courtyard.

238
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,540
Georgette Bello ?

239
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,840
On the fifth floor at the back of the courtyard.

240
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,340
No, Mr. and Mrs. Bello.

241
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,100
Ah, they live on the fourth floor, right.

242
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,920
Ah, they live on the fourth floor, right.

243
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,520
Ah, they live on the fourth right-hand side.

244
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,400
Is there an elevator?

245
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,980
No, take the stairs opposite, the elevator is not working.

246
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,980
No, take the stairs opposite, the elevator is not working.

247
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,340
No, take the stairs opposite, the elevator is not working.

248
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,900
Robert will go up the stairs.

249
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,520
Wipe your feet.

250
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,340
Robert, obediently, wipes his feet.

251
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:40,400
He wipes his feet. He wipes his forehead. She wipes her hands. And he wipes a hat. That's the verb "to wipe".

252
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,660
Now, Robert is in the entrance

253
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,580
This lady is in the entrance

254
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,460
In the entryway, there is a vase with half a dozen roses

255
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,240
That is to say, six roses

256
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,520
Behind the vase, there is a mirror.

257
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,840
A mirror

258
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,740
A mirror

259
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,100
The six roses are reflected in the mirror

260
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,340
That makes a dozen roses

261
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,320
Six roses in the vase and six roses in the mirror, twelve roses.

262
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,680
The roses are reflected in the mirror; that's the verb "to reflect."

263
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,580
Here, the houses opposite are reflected in the windows.

264
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,360
These are people whose reflections are in shop windows.

265
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,920
The trees are reflected in the water.

266
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,540
Here, pink flamingos are reflected in the water.

267
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,320
Here, a castle is reflected in the water.

268
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,140
Here, the towers are reflected in the water.

269
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,240
Here, the boats and houses are reflected in the water.

270
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,120
Here, the abbey of Brantôme is reflected in the water.

271
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,700
These are just reflections.

272
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,600
He's my beloved cowboy.

273
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,620
The French love cowboys.

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,700
Kiluk, the man who shoots faster than his shadow, is a very likeable hero.

275
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,760
Note that the French also like Indians very much.

276
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:21,360
Okay, now let's tour the apartment. We've already seen the entrance. Here's the living room. It's more of a living room than a lounge. Here's a lounge.

277
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,960
In the Bélots' living room, there is a sofa and armchairs.

278
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,640
A sofa, a couch, and armchairs.

279
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:38,020
Second Empire armchairs, a Louis XVI armchair, an armchair at Marcel Proust's aunt's house.

280
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,420
A chair, garden chairs, cafe chairs, church chairs.

281
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,840
Here's someone who repairs chairs.

282
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,900
He repairs chairs too.

283
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,960
There's a piano, a piano, a piano, on the floor, a carpet.

284
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,620
On the wall, a few paintings.

285
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,440
A painting.

286
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,420
The living room connects to the dining room.

287
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,620
There is no door between the two rooms.

288
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,580
It's almost the same room.

289
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,540
The living room opens directly onto the dining room.

290
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,220
In the dining room, the table is set for seven place settings.

291
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,200
A place setting.

292
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,740
Good morning, sir. A place setting, please.

293
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,840
Please.

294
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,220
Here, the table is set for seven place settings.

295
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
There will be seven of them.

296
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,120
Come on, Mr. and Mrs. Belleau, that makes two.

297
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,920
Mireille makes three. Colette makes four.

298
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,460
Marie-Laure makes five. And Robert makes six.

299
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,240
Who is the seventh?

300
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,940
Mystery and bubblegum

301
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,920
There are three bedrooms in the bicycle apartment

302
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,320
The parents' room, Mireille's room, and Marie-Laure's room

303
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,520
There is also a bathroom

304
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,580
There is also a kitchen

305
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,580
This is the cuisine of the courteous

306
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,020
Aunt Georgette's Kitchen

307
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,820
The kitchen of the holiday home

308
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,180
And here is the kitchen of Marcel Proust's aunt in Illiers

309
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:24,800
A living room, a dining room, three bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen

310
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,660
In total, that makes seven pieces

311
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,440
Seven rooms including the kitchen and bathroom

312
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,920
But that's not counting the entrance and the hallway, which aren't really rooms.

313
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,140
And on which floor do you live?

314
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,780
At the fifth

315
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,640
What kind of rooms are there in your apartment?

316
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,960
It's a studio apartment. There's a main room and two small bedrooms.

317
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,940
Is there a kitchen?

318
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,680
Yes, very small.

319
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,260
Anything else?

320
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,660
A small bathroom.

321
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,540
How many coins do you have?

322
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,680
There are four rooms.

323
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,500
What are these parts?

324
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:09,800
The living room, two bedrooms, and then the storage room, the bathroom, the toilet and everything.

325
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,200
You don't have a kitchen?

326
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,280
Yes, yes, the kitchen too, yes, a large kitchen, the living room and the dining room.

327
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:28,240
bicycles overlook the street there is a balcony balconies a balcony a balcony from this balcony we

328
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,260
It has a very pretty view; we have a view of the Luxembourg Gardens. Let's go out onto the balcony for a moment.

329
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,640
I'll show you the view; it's very important, everyone wants a view.

330
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,420
The view!

331
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:58,540
A view of the Pyrenees, a view of the valley and the lake, a view of the valley, a view of the Calanques.

332
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,620
From the Courtois' house, there is a view of Paris.

333
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:09,380
From the Belleaux balcony, you can see the Senate and the Luxembourg Palace, the Pantheon and the Montparnasse Tower.

334
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,580
But we can't see the Eiffel Tower because it's on the other side.

335
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,760
But you can see the top of the Eiffel Tower, from windows overlooking the courtyard.

336
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,640
From these windows, you can also see the towers of Saint-Sulpice.

337
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,900
Let's see, let's take a look around at the towers.

338
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,240
The towers of Notre-Dame, the towers of Chartres Cathedral,

339
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,720
the towers of Carcassonne, a tower of the castle of Chinon,

340
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,080
the towers of a late medieval castle.

341
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,740
The towers of Aigues-Mortes, the Eiffel Tower,

342
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,020
the towers of La Défense, the Montparnasse tower.

343
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,440
A horror, a catastrophe.

344
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,500
Mr. Belleau does not like the Montparnasse Tower.

345
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,420
He doesn't like her.

346
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,080
He says something horrible because he doesn't like it.

347
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,880
Listen.

348
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,800
I'll serve the tea, madam.

349
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,540
Tea, how awful.

350
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,420
It's the scotch today.

351
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,780
Apart from the Montparnasse Tower, which is a disaster, a horror,

352
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,740
Mr. Belleau is very proud of his eyesight.

353
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,480
We really like this apartment because of the view.

354
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,400
An unobstructed view thanks to the Luxembourg Gardens.

355
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,080
It belongs to the state.

356
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,180
No one will ever be able to build in front of our house and take away our view.

357
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,260
A breathtaking view.

358
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,340
Mireille explains to Robert who will be the seventh person at dinner.

359
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,840
This is Hubert.

360
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,720
Hey, I wanted to tell you, my parents have invited a friend of mine, Hubert de Pinot-Chambrin.

361
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,520
He is a childhood friend and comes from a very aristocratic family.

362
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,560
And you'll see, he's always talking about his family, his ancestors.

363
00:23:51,560 --> 00:24:06,160
His family owns a whole bunch of castles, hunting grounds, with dogs, horses, all that stuff.

364
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:15,260
The family owns a large construction company.

365
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,220
He's a funny guy, you'll see.

366
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,300
He's not like everyone else, and he's fun.

367
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,720
He's a strange guy.

368
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,620
Look, you're going to see a funny rabbit.

369
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,500
What is this ?

370
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,360
It's a rabbit.

371
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,160
That's a funny rabbit.

372
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,480
What's so funny about my rabbit?

373
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,360
Now let's see what you have to say.

374
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Look, listen, think, and speak.

375
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,420
You want to go to rue de Vaugirard.

376
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,420
You're a little lost.

377
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,420
You stop a passerby. What do you say to him?

378
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Excuse me, sir. I'm a little lost.

379
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
Rue de Vaugirard, please.

380
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,420
In your opinion, is this the ground floor or the sixth floor?

381
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,700
The sixth floor.

382
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,240
Look at it. Are the headlights on or off?

383
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,320
Turned off.

384
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,580
And here, is the light on or off?

385
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,360
Turned on.

386
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,400
Look closely. Is that a street or a courtyard?

387
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,720
A courtyard.

388
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,220
Is that a staircase or an elevator?

389
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
A staircase.

390
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,420
What is that? Is it a chair or an armchair?

391
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
An armchair.

392
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,420
Is this a dining room or a bedroom?

393
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
A dining room.

394
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
You have a very nice apartment.

395
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,420
Yes, we love it. It's very well located, and there's plenty of sunshine.

396
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,660
It's very well located, it has its rooms,

397
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,480
We count in the kitchen and the bathroom,

398
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,100
There is plenty of sunshine, the toilets are in the Louis XVI style.

399
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,080
Go go

400
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,640
Oh, those two annoy me.

401
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,720
I've had enough, I'm going to sleep.

402
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,340
I've had enough, I'm going to bed.

403
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,740
But what is this, Mr. Guignol?

404
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,280
What are you doing?

405
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
I'm going to bed.

406
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,280
But it's not a bedroom, it's a dining room.

407
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Never mind, Miss Mireille, I'm tired, I'm going to bed.

408
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Oh, that Mr. Guignol is unbearable.

409
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Oh, to lie down in my dining room, no, no, really, listen, oh no.

410
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Here, come out onto the balcony, I'll show you the view.

411
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
A breathtaking view.
